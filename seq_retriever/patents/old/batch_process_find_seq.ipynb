Liraglutide, a GLP-1 analog, has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects on endothelial cells, reducing the activation of NF-kB, inhibiting TNF-alpha, and increasing nitric oxide production. Additionally, liraglutide has benefits in the treatment of acute lung injury, increasing surfactant protein A (SPA) expression in type 2 pneumocytes, decreasing the concentration of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and reducing the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and the severity of lung injury in mouse models. Exendin-4, a GLP-1R agonist, has been shown to lower hepatic production of the inflammatory markers TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6, as well as macrophage markers cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68), and F4/80 in mice fed a western-type (high fat) diet.\n",

Therefore, LXA4 has the ability of anti-inflammation.\n",

Therefore, SPMs have the ability of anti-inflammation.\n",

Epimedium was chosen as the main or monarch ingredient partially because of its TCM warming properties but also because of its in vitro biological activities. Drynaria was chosen as a minister ingredient to the monarch to further strengthen the kidney and to support CRE activation and possible osteogenic activities.

Angelica and Wolfberry Bark were also selected as possible third ingredients to be tested because of their modest anti-inflammatory activity and their lack of activity on isolated ER LBDs.

Hygromycin (1200 μg/mL) and neomycin (400 μg/mL) supplemented DMEM and F12K media, respectively, were used to select monoclonal cell lines which were tested for assay responsiveness and selected for further development.

The ERβ-LBD fragment was then ligated into the pBIND3 PvuI/XbaI site forming a Gal4- ERβ -LBD fusion protein.                            2.5        Cell culture and stable cell lines        Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1), MC3T3-E1 subclone 14, HEK293T/17, SK-N-SH, and A549 were purchased from ATCC (Manasas, VA) and grown in in DMEM or αMEM or DMEM or EMEM or F12K media, respectively.<br>"
