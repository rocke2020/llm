Therapeutic benefit can mean eradication of the underlying disease being treated. Also, a therapeutic benefit can be achieved with the eradication of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disease such that an improvement can be observed in a subject notwithstanding that, in some embodiments, the subject can still be afflicted with the underlying disease.The terms \\u201ceffective amount\\u201d, \\u201ctherapeutically effective amount\\u201d or \\u201cpharmaceutically effective amount\\u201d as used herein, can refer to a sufficient amount of a compound being administered which will at least partially ameliorate a symptom of a disease or condition being treated.The terms \\u201ccompound\\u201d, \\u201cagent\\u201d, or \\u201ctherapeutic agent\\u201d can be used to refer to a peptide as described herein. In some cases, the terms \\u201cadditional compound\\u201d, \\u201cadditional agent\\u201d, or \\u201cadditional therapeutic agent\\u201d can be used to refer to a peptide as described herein.

In some instances, \\u201ccompound, \\u201cagent\\u201d, and \\u201ctherapeutic agent\\u201d can be used interchangeably.The terms \\u201cpeptide\\u201d and \\u201cpolypeptide\\u201d can be used interchangeably to encompass both naturally-occurring and non-naturally occurring proteins, and fragments, mutants, derivatives and analogs thereof. A polypeptide may be monomeric or polymeric. Further, a polypeptide may comprise a number of different domains each of which has one or more distinct activities. For the avoidance of doubt, a \\u201cpolypeptide\\u201d may be any length greater two amino acids. A peptide can comprise an overall charge based on pka of side chains of component amino acids. In some instances, a peptide can have an overall positive charge. In some instances, a peptide can have an overall negative charge. In some instances, a peptide can have an overall neutral charge. A peptide can furthermore exist as a zwitterion.A peptide described herein can be useful as an antimicrobial peptide, for example, against bacteria, fungi, yeast, parasites, protozoa and viruses. The term, \\u201cantimicrobial peptide\\u201d can be used herein to define any peptide that has microbicidal and/or microbistatic activity and encompasses, non-exclusively, any peptide described as having anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-mycotic, anti-parasitic, anti-protozoal, anti-viral, anti-infectious, anti-infective and/or germicidal, algicidal, amoebicidal, microbicidal, bactericidal, fungicidal, parasiticidal, protozoacidal, protozoicidal properties.The term \\u201crecombinant\\u201d can refer to a biomolecule, e.g., a gene or protein, that (1) can be removed from its naturally occurring environment, (2) can be isolated from all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the gene may be found in nature, (3) can be operatively linked to a polynucleotide which it may not be linked to in nature, or (4) does not occur in nature. The term \\u201crecombinant\\u201d can be used in reference to cloned DNA isolates, chemically synthesized polynucleotide analogs, or polynucleotide analogs that are biologically synthesized by heterologous systems, as well as proteins and/or mRNAs encoded by such nucleic acids. Thus, for example, a protein synthesized by a microorganism can be recombinant, for example, if it is synthesized from an mRNA synthesized from a recombinant gene present in the cell.The term \\u201chomology\\u201d can refer to a % identity of a polypeptide to a reference polypeptide. As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide can be at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to any reference amino acid sequence of any polypeptide described herein (which may correspond with a particular nucleic acid sequence described herein), such particular polypeptide sequence can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such the Bestfit program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis. 53711). When using Bestfit or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is, for instance, 95% identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention, the parameters can be set such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference amino acid sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5% of the total number of amino acid residues in the reference sequence are allowed.For example, in a specific embodiment the identity between a reference sequence (query sequence, i.e., a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, may be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (Comp. App. Biosci. 6:237-245 (1990)). In some embodiments, parameters for a particular embodiment in which identity is narrowly construed, used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment, can include: Scoring Scheme=PAM (Percent Accepted Mutations) 0, k-tuple=2, Mismatch Penalty=1, Joining Penalty=20, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=1, Window Size=sequence length, Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size Penalty=0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence, whichever is shorter. According to this embodiment, if the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N- or C-terminal deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction can be made to the results to take into consideration the fact that the FASTDB program does not account for N- and C-terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N- and C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity can be corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are lateral to the N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. A determination of whether a residue is matched/aligned can be determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage can be then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score can be used for the purposes of this embodiment. In some embodiments, only residues to the N- and C-termini of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is, only query residue positions outside the farthest N- and C-terminal residues of the subject sequence are considered for this manual correction. For example, a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence can be aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N-terminus of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching/alignment of the first 10 residues at the N-terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10% of the sequence (number of residues at the N- and C-termini not matched/total number of residues in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N- or C-termini of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only residue positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as displayed in the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for.The terms \\u201cco-administration\\u201d, \\u201cadministered in combination with\\u201d and their grammatical equivalents or the like, as used herein, can encompass administration of selected therapeutic agents to a subject, and can include treatment regimens in which agents are administered by the same or different route of administration or at the same or different times. In some embodiments, a peptide disclosed herein can be co-administered with other agents. These terms can encompass administration of two or more agents to a subject so that both agents and/or their metabolites are present in the subject at the same time. They can include simultaneous administration, administration at different times, and/or administration in a composition in which both agents are present. Thus, in some embodiments, a peptide and an additional agent(s) can be administered in a single composition. In some embodiments, a peptide and an additional agent(s) can be admixed in the composition. In some embodiments, a same peptide or agent can be administered via a combination of different routes of administration. In some embodiments, each agent administered can be in a therapeutically effective amount.As used herein, the term \\u201cbioavailability\\u201d can denote the degree to which a drug such as a peptide, salt, metabolite, or other substance becomes available to the target tissue after administration.Parameters often used in pharmacokinetic (PK) studies can include Tmax, Cmax, AUC(0-\\u221e), AUC(0-t), and T1/2 and CL/F. \\u201cTmax\\u201d can refer to the time to reach the maximal plasma concentration (\\u201cCmax\\u201d) after administration of a therapeutic; \\u201cAUC(0-\\u221e)\\u201d can refer to the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity; \\u201cAUC(0-t)\\u201d can refer to the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 to time t; \\u201cT1/2\\u201d can refer to a half-life of a therapeutic in blood plasma; \\u201cT1/2, elim\\u201d can refer to the half-life of elimination of the therapeutic from circulation; and \\u201cCL/F\\u201d can refer to an apparent clearance rate of a therapeutic.\",\n",
      "              \"V. Applications--A peptide disclosed herein, salt thereof, or a composition containing a peptide or salt thereof can be administered to a subject in order to at least partially ameliorate a disease or condition. A subject can be in need of a treatment of a disease or condition. In some cases, a subject may have been previously diagnosed with a disease or condition described herein, and/or may be at risk of developing a disease or condition as described herein.As previously discussed, a peptide disclosed herein, salt thereof, or a composition containing a peptide or salt thereof can be engineered to provide a therapeutic effect by disruption of integrity of a membrane of a target. This disruption of structural integrity can occur through (a) binding to a negatively charged surface on a membrane; and/or (b) integrating into a membrane. The ability of a peptide to bind to a negatively charged surface on a membrane and/or integrate into a membrane can allow a peptide to act as a toxic agent through disruption of membrane integrity.Use as an AntibioticIn some cases, a peptide disclosed herein, salt thereof, or a composition containing a peptide or salt thereof can be an antibiotic. As previously described above, the production of novel antimicrobial agents, particularly antibiotics, is paramount due to the emergence of pathogens resistant to traditional antimicrobial compounds.A peptide described herein can be engineered using a principle described herein to produce a peptide capable of (a) binding to a bacterial membrane, and/or (b) integrating into a bacterial membrane. As both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are known to display negatively-charged moieties on a surface of their bacterial membranes, a peptide containing positively-charged moieties can target negatively charged bacterial membranes specifically, and with broad spectrum activity. As host mammalian cell membranes can be uncharged overall due to the asymmetric expression of negatively charged moieties such as phosphatidylserine on the inner leaflet of a membrane, a peptide can be engineered to specifically target a negatively-charged bacterial membrane while avoiding an uncharged host membrane, thereby increasing the safety of a peptide. A peptide described herein can preferably target a bacterial cell. In some aspects, a peptide described herein can be toxic to a bacterial cell but not a host cell.Furthermore, while a peptide as described herein can bind and/or integrate into a bacterial membrane of both gram-positive and gram-negative membranes, a peptide can also have the surprising and unexpected ability to bind to and block the action of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on the surface gram-negative bacteria. LPS are large molecules consisting of a lipid and a polysaccharide composed of 0-antigen, outer core and inner core joined by a covalent bond. LPS can be found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. In some cases, LPS can elicit a strong immune response in animals. By binding to LPS molecules on the surface of a gram-negative bacterial strain, it is envisaged that the endotoxic activity of LPS can be mitigated.In some cases, a peptide can at least partially adopt an \\u03b1-helical structure. An \\u03b1-helical structure can more effectively integrate into a membrane of the bacterial cell, thereby improving the ability of a peptide to disrupt the structural integrity of the bacterial membrane. In some cases, a peptide can adopt an \\u03b1-helix upon synthesis. In some cases, a peptide can adopt an \\u03b1-helix when in an aqueous environment. In some cases, a peptide can adopt an \\u03b1-helix when contacted with a bacterial membrane.A bacterial pathogen may be derived from a bacterial species selected from the group, but not exclusive to the group, consisting of: Staphylococcus spp., e.g. Staphylococcus aureus (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 10442 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis; Chlamydia spp., e.g. Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci; Enterococcus spp., e.g. Enterococcus faecalis; Streptococcus pyogenes; Listeria spp.; Pseudomonas spp.; Mycobacterium spp., e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex; Enterobacter spp.; Campylobacter spp.; Salmonella spp.; Streptococcus spp., e.g. Streptococcus Group A or B, Streptoccocus pneumoniae; Helicobacter spp., e.g. Helicobacter pylori, Helicobacter felis; Neisseria spp., e.g. Neisseria gonorrhoea, Neisseria meningitidis; Borrelia burgdorferi; Shigella spp., e.g. Shigella flexneri; Escherichia coli (E. coli 0157:H7 NCTC 12900); Haemophilus spp., e.g. Haemophilus influenzae; Francisella tularensis; Bacillus spp., e.g. Bacillus anthraces; Clostridia spp., e.g. Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium difficile; Yersinia spp., e.g. Yersinia pestis; Treponema spp.; Burkholderia spp., e.g. Burkholderia cepacia complex, B. mallei, B pseudomallei; Propionibacterium spp., e.g. P. acnes, Acinetobacter species, an Actinomyces species, a Campylobacter species, a Candida species, Corynebacterium minutissium, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtherias, Corynebacterium stratium, Corynebacterium group G1, Corynebacterium group G2, Enterobacteriaceae, an Enterococcus species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, a Moraxella species, a non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, a Porphyromonas species, Prevotella melaninogenicus, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Vibrio cholerae, a Coccidioides species, or a Cryptococcus species.A microbial biofilm, also referred to as a biological biofilm, can be a community of microbial cells embedded in an extracellular matrix of polymeric substances and adherent to a biological or a non-biotic surface. A range of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and/or protozoa, with associated bacteriophages and other viruses) can be found in these biofilms. Biofilms are ubiquitous in nature, are commonly found in a wide range of environments. Biofilms are being increasingly recognized by the scientific and medical community as being implicated in many infections, and especially their contribution to the recalcitrance of infection treatment. Biofilms can be etiologic agents for a number of disease states in mammals and are involved in 80% of infections in humans. Examples can include skin and wound infections, middle-ear infections, gastrointestinal tract infections, peritoneal membrane infections, urogenital tract infections, oral soft tissue infections, formation of dental plaque, eye infections (including contact lens contamination), endocarditis, infections in cystic fibrosis, and infections of indwelling medical devices such as joint prostheses, dental implants, catheters and cardiac implants. Microbes in biofilms can be significantly more resistant to antimicrobial treatment than their planktonic counterparts. Biofilm formation is not limited solely to the ability of microbes to attach to a surface. Microbes growing in a biofilm can interact more between each other than with the actual physical substratum on which the biofilm initially developed.The suggested mechanisms by which biofilm-associated microorganisms elicit diseases in their host can include the following: (i) delayed penetration of the antimicrobial agent through the biofilm matrix, (ii) detachment of cells or cell aggregates from indwelling medical device biofilms, (iii) production of endotoxins, (iv) resistance to the host immune system, (v) provision of a niche for the generation of resistant organisms through horizontal gene transfer of antimicrobial resistance &/or virulence determinant genes, and (vi) altered growth rate (i.e. metabolic dormancy).In some cases, bacteria, fungi, and/or protozoa, with associated bacteriophages and other viruses described herein can secrete a biofilm. In some cases, bacteria, fungi, and/or protozoa, with associated bacteriophages and other viruses described herein can form a biofilm. A peptide, salt thereof described herein, or a composition comprising a peptide or salt thereof described herein can be administered to at least partially penetrate, inhibit formation of, or destroy a biological biofilm. In some instances, additional agents can be added to at least partially inhibit formation of, or destroy, a biological biofilm.

Topical fungal infections of nails and skin are generally caused by detinatophytes although some non-dermatophytes such as yeast can also cause skin infections. A dermatophyte infection may include a Tinea infection for example Tinea barbae (beard), Tinea capitis (head), Tinea corporis (body), Tinea cruris (groin), Tinea faciei (face), Tinea manuum (hand), Tinea pedis (foot) Tinea unguium (nail), Tinea (Pityriasis) versicolor, Tinea incognito or Tinea nigra. An infection may be derived from fungi of the genera Epidermophyton, Microsporum or Trichophyton spp. (e.g. T. rubrum and T interdigitale).Exemplary TreatmentIn some cases, a peptide, salt thereof, or composition containing a peptide or salt thereof can be administered to a subject for treatment of a dermatophytic infection. A dermatophytic infection may be an infection of a skin, lamina, stratum corneum, nails (fingernails and toenails) or hair. Of particular mention are dermatophytic infections caused by a dermatophyte of the genera Trichophyton, Epidermophyton or Microsporum. Exemplary dermatophytes can include Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, Microsporum audouinii, Microsporum gypseum, Microsporum nanum, Microsporum ferrugineum, Microsporum distortum, Microsporum fulvum, Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton tnentagrophytes var. interdigitale, Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. nodulare, Trichophyton tonsurans, Trichophyton soudanese, Trichophyton violaceum, Trichophyton megnini, Trichophyton schoenlenii, Trichophyton gallinae, Trichophyton kraj denii, Trichophyton yaoundei, Trichophyton equinum, Trichophyton erinacei and Trichophyton verrucosum.In some cases, a dermatophytic infection can be onychomycosis. The term \\u201conychomycosis\\u201d can include, but is not limited to, distal lateral subungual, superficial white, proximal white subungual, secondary dystrophic, primary dystrophic, endonyx, candidal (e.g. onycholysis & chronic mucocutaneous disease) types of onychomycosis and Tinea ungium. Non-dermatophytic fungi associated with onychomycosis can include Aspergillus spp. Cephalosporum spp., Fusarium oxysporum, Scopularis brevicaulis, and Scytalidium spp.A peptide described herein can be a potent antimicrobial peptides for a wide variety of pathogenic organisms. However, a peptide described herein may also be useful in a treatment of other conditions including, but not limited to, conditions associated with mucosal infections, for example, cystic fibrosis, gastrointestinal, urogenital, urinary (e.g kidney infection or cystitis) or respiratory infections.Use as an Anti-Cancer AgentIn some cases, a peptide disclosed herein, salt thereof, or a composition containing a peptide or salt thereof can be an anticancer agent.Rather than taking a kill all approach, as is the case for many forms of cancer treatment such as chemotherapy and radiation treatment, there is an unmet need for the production of therapeutics that specifically target cancer or tumor cells without having a toxic effect on normal, healthy cells.One treatment strategy can be to target the vasculature of solid tumors. Destruction of the blood vessels can lead to an amplification of the anti-tumor effect, as many tumor cells rely on a single vessel for their oxygen and nutrients. Exemplary vascular targeting agents (VTAs) are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,855,866, 5,965,132, 6,261,535, 6,051,230 and 6,451,312, which describe the targeted delivery of anti-cellular agents and toxins to markers of tumor vasculature.Recently, phosphatidylserine (PS) was identified as a specific marker of tumor vasculature (Ran et al., 1998). This led to the development of new anti-PS immunoconjugates for delivering anti-cellular agents, toxins and coagulation factors to tumor blood vessels (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,312,694, 6,783,760 and 6,818,213). As PS can be specifically overpopulated on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane relative to normal cells, PS can be used as a marker for specific cancers. A peptide described herein can be an ideal candidate for the disruption of a structural integrity of a membrane in cancer cells in the same manner as described with respect to bacterial membranes. This can be due to the overall negative charge of the PS moiety, which can allow a peptide described herein to bind to said PS moiety and/or integrate into the membrane of the tumor cell.A peptide described herein can be engineered to target a cancer or tumor cell, thereby alleviating cancer in a subject through at least partially arresting a growth rate of a cancer cell or tumor. In some cases, a cancer can be leukemia; melanoma; squamous cell carcinoma; neuroblastoma; colorectal adenocarcinoma; lymphoma; prostate; renal; glioblastoma; rhabdomyosarcoma; breast cancer; metastatic breast cancer; or astrocytoma.

This can include laboratory technicians, healthcare professionals, military personnel, or law enforcement professionals.In some cases, a subject can be in an alternative care facility. Examples of alternative care facilities can include a holistic care facility, a nursing home, or a retirement home. In some cases, a subject can be under home care. In such examples, a peptide, salt thereof, or a composition containing a peptide or salt thereof can be administered by a non-licensed healthcare professional to include a subject themselves.Other ApplicationsAlso disclosed herein are methods of producing a coating comprising a peptide disclosed herein, salt thereof, or a composition containing a peptide or salt thereof. A coating can be an antimicrobial coating that can be applied to a surface to remove contaminants from a surface, or to prevent contamination in the first instance. A coating can comprise an antimicrobial peptide disclosed herein. A coating can generally be prepared by contacting a coating material with a peptide disclosed herein, salt thereof, or a composition containing a peptide or salt thereof.In some cases, a coating can be in the form of a film, sheet, liquid, or aerosol used to coat a biological or non biological surface. A film can be prepared by coating material capable of producing a film with a peptide disclosed herein, salt thereof, or a composition containing a peptide or salt thereof. A coating material capable of producing a film can be an adhesive compound, such as a mucoadhesive, used to bind a compound to a biological surface. An exemplary mucoadhesive can be a highly negatively charged polymer such as polycarbophil. A coating material capable of producing a film can be adhered to a biological surface to treat or prevent an infection on a biological surface. For example, a peptide described herein can be formulated as a coating for adherence onto an open wound, thereby eliminating a need for a bandage by directly adhering an antimicrobial compound to a site of action. Further applications can include adhering a coating onto a transplanted organ to prevent infection by a pathogen during a transplant process.In some cases, a coating can comprise a peptide disclosed herein, salt thereof, or a composition containing a peptide or salt thereof can be used to sterilize a surface. For example, a coating can be applied to surgical equipment, and any surface in contact with surgical equipment, prior to an operation. Such practice can mitigate a risk contamination of the surgical equipment during transport. Scientific equipment can also be coated with such a coating to prevent cross contamination of certain microbes that could interfere with a measurement to be taken with the equipment.Further examples of the use of a coating containing a peptide described herein can include coating an article such as a medical device. In some cases, the medical device can be an implantable medical device. For example, a medical device such as a catheter or prosthetic limb can be coated with a coating as described above to prevent contamination during packaging, storage, or during a transplant operation. In some cases, a peptide can be the sole antimicrobial compound in a coating. In other instances, a coating can comprise other antimicrobial compounds such as those described herein. Metallic antimicrobial compounds such as silver nitrate can also be used in combination with a peptide scribed herein.An article for implant in contact with a coating containing a peptide, salt thereof, or pharmaceutical composition can be assembled as a composition containing an article and coating.\",\n",

Peptides of SEQ ID NO:5 and SEQ ID NO:8 were brought up in 100% DMSO with 0.002% polysorbate-80 at 1.28 mg/mL (40\\u00d7 the highest final test concentration of 32 mcg/mL). Final test concentration of DMSO was 2.5% in the assay at the first dilution for those two compounds.Test MediumMueller Hinton II broth (MHB II; BD; Lot Nos. 6258541 and 7143896) was used for MIC testing of aerobic organisms. 0.002% polysorbate 80 (P80) was added to the test medium.Broth Microdilution MIC MethodologyMIC values were determined using a broth microdilution procedure described by CLSI (1, 3). Automated liquid handlers (Multidrop 384, Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland; Biomek 2000 and Biomek FX, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton Calif.) were used to conduct serial dilutions and liquid transfers.To prepare the drug mother plates, which would provide the serial peptide dilutions for the replicate daughter plates, the wells of columns 2-12 of standard 96-well microdilution plates (Costar 3795) were filled with 150 \\u03bcl of the designated diluent for each row of peptide. The test articles and comparator compounds (300 \\u03bcl at 40\\u00d7 the highest concentration to be tested) were dispensed into the appropriate wells in column 1. The Biomek 2000 was then used to make 2-fold serial dilutions in the mother plates from column 1 through column 11. The wells of Column 12 contained no drug and served as the organism growth control wells for the assay.The daughter plates were loaded with 185 \\u03bcL per well of MHB II using the Multidrop 384. The daughter plates were completed on the Biomek FX instrument which transferred 5 uL of peptide solution from each well of a mother plate to the corresponding well of each daughter plate in a single step. A standardized inoculum of each test organism was prepared per CLSI methods. The inoculum for each organism was dispensed into sterile reservoirs divided by length (Beckman Coulter), and the Biomek 2000 was used to inoculate the plates. Daughter plates were placed on the Biomek 2000 work surface in reverse orientation so that inoculation took place from low to high drug concentration. The plates were then inoculated with 10 \\u03bcL of the inoculum resulting in a final cell density of approximately 5\\u00d7105 CFU/mL, per well.Plates were stacked 3-4 high, covered with a lid on the top plate, placed in plastic bags, and incubated at 35\\u00b0 C. for 16 to 20 hrs. Following incubation, the microplates were removed from the incubator and viewed from the bottom using a plate viewer. For each date of assay, an uninoculated solubility control plate was observed for sterility and evidence of drug precipitation. The MIC was read and recorded as the lowest concentration of peptide that inhibited visible growth of the organism.The results of the bacterial inhibition study are depicted in Table 2.TABLE 2MIC (\\u03bcg/mL)Formu-Formu-Formu-Formu-Formu-Formu-Formu-la Ala Bla Dla E1la E3la E4la GSEQ IDSEQ IDSEQ IDSEQ IDSEQ IDSEQ IDSEQ IDSEQ IDIsolateNO: 1NO: 2NO: 3NO: 4NO: 5NO: 6NO: 7NO: 8ColistinLevofloxacinMeropenemStaphylococcus81688160.5>32>32>320.251(0.06-0.5)20.12(0.03-0.12)aureusATCC 29213(MSSA; QC)Staphylococcus4168480.5>3232>32\\u20020.25>4aureusATCC 43300(MRSA)Staphylococcus488480.5>32>32>328\\u2009\\u2002>4aureusNRS382(USA100;HA-MRSA)Streptococcus16>323216328>32>32>321(0.5-2)0.03(0.03-0.25)pneumoniaeATCC 49619(QC)Streptococcus83216163241616>320.5\\u22640.004pyogenesATCC 49399Streptococcus8>32328328>3232>320.50.008agalactiaeATCC 13813Enterococcus8>32328162>324>321(0.25-2)4(2-8)faecalisATCC 29212(VSE; QC)Enterococcus4>32>328164>324>320.54faecalisATCC 700802(V583 VRE)Enterococcus2164480.5160.25>3216 3\\u2002\\u2002>4faeciumATCC 51559(VRE)Escherichia41644162>32>320.12 (0.25-2)0.015(0.008-0.06)0.015(0.008-0.06)coliATCC 25922(QC)Escherichia8164816132>320.12\\u20020.030.015coliATCC 35218(ESBL)Escherichia2324432116>320.0664\\u2009\\u2003>4coliATCCBAA-2471(NDM-1)Klebsiella8>323232>324>32>320.1264\\u2009\\u2003>4pneumoniaeATCCBAA-1705(KPC)Pseudomonas8>3248>3216>32>320.25 (0.5-4)1(0.5-4)0.25(0.12-1)aeruginosaATCC 27853(non-MDR;QC)Pseudomonas4824168>32160.121\\u2009\\u20020.015aeruginosaATCCBAA-2109(MDR)Acinetobacter23288160.5>32320.25\\u20020.250.5baumanniiATCC 19606(non-MDR)Acinetobacter4>32168320.5>32>320.54\\u2009\\u2002>4baumanniiATCCBAA-1797(MDR)Peptides described herein displayed superior antimicrobial activity as determined by MIC against the bacteria species tested when compared to traditional antibiotics Colistin, Levofloxacin, and Meropenem.\",\n",

The clinical isolates were obtained from USA hospitals. Upon initial receipt at Micromyx, the organisms were sub-cultured onto an appropriate agar medium. Following incubation, colonies were harvested from these plates and cell suspensions prepared and frozen at \\u221280\\u00b0 C. with a cryoprotectant. Prior to testing, the isolates were streaked from frozen vials onto Trypticase Soy Agar with 5% sheep blood (Becton Dickenson [BD]; Sparks, Md.; Lot Nos. 7173618, 7166759, 7208688, 72144895, 7228505 and Remel Lenexa, Kans. Lot No. 212574). Plates were incubated at 35\\u00b0 C. overnight.Test MediumMueller Hinton II broth (MHB II; BD; Lot Nos. 6258541 and 7143896) was used for MIC testing of aerobic organisms. For SEQ ID NO:1 0.002% polysorbate 80 (P80) was added to the test medium.Broth Microdilution MIC MethodologyMIC values were determined using a broth microdilution procedure described by CLSI (1, 3).

The Biomek 2000 was then used to make 2-fold serial dilutions in the mother plates from column 1 through column 11. The wells of Column 12 contained no drug and served as the organism growth control wells for the assay.The daughter plates were loaded with 185 \\u03bcL per well of MHB II using the Multidrop 384. The daughter plates were completed on the Biomek FX instrument which transferred 5 \\u25a1L of drug solution from each well of a mother plate to the corresponding well of each daughter plate in a single step.

For each date of assay, an uninoculated solubility control plate was observed for sterility and evidence of drug precipitation. The MIC was read and recorded as the lowest concentration of drug that inhibited visible growth of the organism.Results and DiscussionThe summary data for evaluating SEQ ID NO:1 against the ESKAPE pathogens and E. coli are shown in Tables 4-10 and FIGS. 6-12. The tables contain the MIC ranges, modes, MIC50 and MIC90 values, whereas the figures show the MIC distributions, for SEQ ID NO:1 and each comparator against Enterococcus faecium (Table 4 and FIG. 6), Staphylococcus aureus (Table 5 and FIG. 7), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Table 6 and FIG. 8), Acinetobacter (Table 7 and FIG. 9), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Table 8 and FIG. 10), Enterobacter (Table 9 and FIG. 11) and Escherichia coli (Table 10 and FIG. 12). The MIC values for the control drugs against the QC organisms were within established CLSI QC ranges, with the exception of colistin on two test days. Clinical breakpoints to determine percent resistance within a given organism group were obtained from CLSI (3), with the exception of colistin for K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., and E. coli, which are only available from EUCAST.Significant precipitation was observed during broth dilution testing of SEQ ID NO:1 at the concentrations of 128, 64 and 32 \\u03bcg/mL, and slight precipitation was observed at 16 and 8 \\u03bcg/mL. Depending on the organism and test day, MICs could be read occasionally with either of these two concentrations.As shown in Table 4, against E. faecium (n=104) SEQ ID NO:1 had an MIC50/90 value of 1/2 \\u03bcg/mL, with a range of <0.12 to 4 \\u03bcg/mL. Nearly half of these isolates were vancomycin-resistant and four were linezolid-resistant. In addition, 25% were resistant to doxycycline and 78.8% were levofloxacin-resistant. SEQ ID NO:1 was the most active agent against, followed by linezolid with MIC50/90 values of 2/4 \\u03bcg/mL and an MIC range of 1 to 32 \\u03bcg/mL; vancomycin was the least active with MIC50/90 values of 1/>32 and an MIC range of 0.25 to >32 \\u03bcg/mL.

All of these isolates were methicillin-resistant; there were two that were also linezolid-resistant. Over 80% were resistant to levofloxacin and 37.5% of these S. aureus isolates were resistant to clindamycin. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was the most active agent against this set of organisms, with MIC50/90 values of 0.06/0.12 \\u03bcg/mL and an MIC range of 0.03 to >8 \\u03bcg/mL. Levofloxacin and clindamycin were the least active agents against this set of S. aureus (MIC50/90=8/>8 and 0.12/>16 \\u03bcg/mL, respectively). The MIC distributions against the S. aureus isolates are shown in FIG. 7, with SEQ ID NO:1 demonstrating a narrow distribution, mostly between 2 and 8 \\u03bcg/mL.TABLE 5DrugMIC rangeModeMIC50MIC90% R1StaphylococcusSEQ ID NO: 1\\u2003\\u20091-16448\\u2014aureusLinezolid\\u20031-82221.9(n = 104)Daptomycin0.25-4\\u20020.50.51\\u2014Vancomycin0.5-21110Doxycycline0.06-8\\u20020.120.1210Trimethoprim -0.03->80.060.060.123.8SulfamethoxazoleClindamycin\\u20020.03->16>160.12>1637.5Levofloxacin0.12->8>88>882.7Table 6 shows that SEQ ID NO:1 had an MIC range of 2 to >16 \\u03bcg/mL and MIC50/90 of 8/>16 \\u03bcg/mL against the panel of K. pneumoniae (n=101). As shown in the MIC distribution of FIG. 8, SEQ ID NO:1 had an MIC of 8 \\u03bcg/mL against the majority of isolates. Over 80% of these isolates were resistant to ceftazidime, and over 60% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, tobramycin, or levofloxacin. Fifty percent were meropenem-resistant, whereas 27.7% were colistin-resistant. Meropenem and colistin had the best activity against this set of K. pneumoniae, though FIG. 8 shows that both drugs had a bimodal distribution due to the presence of resistant organisms within the set, including those producing extended-spectrum \\u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs) or that were colistin-resistant. The comparator with the weakest activity by MIC50/90 was piperacillin-tazobactam (>128/>128 \\u03bcg/mL).TABLE 6DrugMIC rangeModeMIC50MIC90% R1KlebsiellaSEQ ID NO: 1\\u2003\\u20092->1688>16\\u2014pneumoniaeCeftolozane-0.12->32>32>32>3263.4(n = 101)TazobactamPiperacillin -\\u2003\\u2002\\u20092->128>128>128>12869.3TazobactamMeropenem0.015->8\\u2003>84>850.5Tobramycin0.12->6416166459.4Ceftazidime0.25->32>32>32>3280.2Colistin0.06->320.120.123227.7Levofloxacin0.03->8\\u2002>8>8>867.3The 104 Acinetobacter isolates in this study were predominantly A. baumannii (80%), but also included A. pittii, A. radioresistens, A. lwoffii and A. junii. Levofloxacin- and ceftazidime-resistance among this set were 66.3 and 61.5%, respectively, and there were 65.4% that were meropenem-resistant. Colistin-resistance (20.2%) was fairly common as well, although this drug displayed good activity (MIC50/90 of 0.25/>32 \\u03bcg/mL). Against this set of Acinetobacter (Table 7), SEQ ID NO:1 demonstrated an MIC50 of 4 \\u03bcg/mL and an MIC90 of 16 \\u03bcg/mL, with an MIC range of 0.5 to >16 \\u03bcg/mL. By MIC50/90, piperacillin-tazobactam was the comparator with the weakest activity (MIC50/90=>128/>128 \\u03bcg/mL); indeed, 72.1% of the isolates in this set were resistant to this drug combination.

Twenty-one percent of these isolates were resistant to levofloxacin and 20% were meropenem-resistant. Resistance to colistin was observed among 7.3% of the isolates in this set. Piperacillin-tazobactam had the weakest activity by MIC50/90 (16/>128 \\u03bcg/mL) though only 13.8% of isolates were resistant to the combination; the best activity against these P. aeruginosa isolates was demonstrated by colistin, with an MIC50/90 value of 0.5/1 \\u03bcg/mL.

      "              \"III. Peptides--Disclosed herein are novel, rationally designed peptides engineered for use as novel therapeutics. In some instances, a rationally designed peptide can be used as an antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal, or antitumor agent when administered to a subject. In other embodiments, a peptide disclosed herein can comprise a random design and having anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-mycotic, anti-parasitic, anti-protozoal, anti-viral, anti-infectious, anti-infective and/or germicidal, algicidal, amoebicidal, microbicidal, bactericidal, fungicidal, parasiticidal, protozoacidal, protozoicidal properties.The production of novel antimicrobial agents is paramount due to the emergence of pathogens resistant to traditional antimicrobial compounds. Thus, there is a long felt, unmet need for new and effective antimicrobial agents.In some instances, a peptide disclosed herein can be rationally designed to mimic a host-derived peptide. The use of host-derived peptides can be advantageous in that host-derived peptides can potentially mitigate adverse host reactions upon administration to a subject. The potential of using host-derived peptides as antimicrobial agents is described in an article by Hancock et al. Such peptides are of interest due to their role in innate vertebrate immunity. In some instances, these host derived peptides can comprise a portion of neutrophil proteins involved in immunity, for example vertebrate immunity. In some instances, peptides can be cationic peptides comprising an overall positive charge on a surface of the peptide. In other instances, peptides can have an overall neutral or negative change on a surface of the peptide. In some instances, a peptide can fit into at least one structural category: (i) \\u03b2-sheet structures that are stabilized by multiple disulfide bonds (e.g., human defensin-1), (ii) covalently stabilized loop structures (e.g., bactenecin), (iii) tryptophan (Trp)-rich, extended helical peptides (e.g., indolicidin), and (iv) amphipathic \\u03b1-helices (e.g., the magainins and cecropins).While host-derived peptides can be potent antimicrobials, host-derived peptides have typically evolved against specific pathogens. Such specificity can limit their use as broad spectrum antimicrobials. On the other hand, novel protein scaffolds can be designed employing a similar structural motif to a host-derived peptide for use as antimicrobial therapeutics.The use of a protein scaffold based on lentiviral lytic proteins (LLPs) as a model for engineering broad spectrum antimicrobial compounds is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,887,847. LLP based peptide analogs can be designed utilizing, for example, the following principles: (i) optimizing amphipathicity, (ii) substituting arginine (Arg) on the charged face and/or valine (Val) or tryptophan (Trp) on the hydrophobic face with another amino acid, and (iii) increasing peptide length.Other peptide scaffolds can be engineered using similar concepts while employing rational design to increase overall potency and pharmacokinetics of administered agents. In some cases, a peptide that is substantially helical can be used. Examples can include a single helix, coiled-coils, 4-helix bundles, globulins, and the like. In some cases, a peptide that is substantially composed of \\u03b2-strands can be used. Examples can include structures such as \\u03b2-sheets, SH3 domains, \\u03b2-hairpins, Greek keys, \\u03b2-propellers, \\u03b2-barrels, immunoglobulins, and the like. In some cases, a peptide can be composed of both \\u03b1-helices and \\u03b2-strands. Examples can include zinc fingers, TIM barrels, ferredoxins, SH2 domains, leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) proteins, flavodoxins, and the like. In some cases, novel, non-canonical scaffolds such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,548,249 and 6,818,418 can be employed.Design PrinciplesDisclosed herein are novel peptides for use as antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal and/or antitumor agents. In some instances, a peptide can be a rationally designed peptide. In some cases, a rationally designed peptide can comprise a linear structure. In some cases, a linear structure can be at least transient. In some cases, a rationally designed peptide can comprise a cyclical structure. In some cases, a cyclical structure can be at least transient. In some cases, a rationally designed peptide can comprise a helical structure. In some cases, a helical structure can be at least transient. A peptide with a structure as described herein can be engineered and/or optimized to increase the potency of a therapeutic. A peptide disclosed herein can be engineered as a novel therapeutic employing and/or designed with the consideration of one or more of the following principles:                (i) ability to adopt an \\u03b1-helical structure;        (ii) localization of positively-charged moieties;        (iii) optimization of amphipathicity (or amphilicity);        (iv) optimizing the length of the peptide.Employing at least one of the principles described above can be used to rationally design peptides able to bind to a negatively charged surface on a membrane and/or integrate into a membrane for use as a therapeutic agent.In some exemplary embodiments, a peptide disclosed herein can be an \\u03b1-helical peptide. In the case of an alpha helix, a rational design of a peptide can employ of one or more of the following principles:                (i) ability to adopt the \\u03b1-helical structure when contacted with a membrane;        (ii) localization of positively-charged moieties on a face of the helix;        (iii) optimization of amphipathicity (or amphilicity) by localizing a varying number of polar and nonpolar residues on opposing faces of the helix;        (iv) alignment of aromatic residues along an axis between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces;        (v) burying a positively-charged moiety on the non-polar or hydrophobic face of the helix;        (vi) optimizing the length of the peptide.In some instances, an \\u03b1-helical peptide described herein can conform to at least one of principles listed herein. In some instances, a peptide described herein can conform to at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or all 6 of principles described herein.FIGS. 1A-1C depict exemplary design principles employed in the design of a polypeptide described herein.In some cases, the peptide can be at least partially conformationally constrained. A constrained peptide can be a helical peptide, a cyclic peptide, and the like. Examples of constraining means can include a disulfide bond, a staple, a stich, and the like.In some cases, a peptide can be engineered to modulate an overall amphipathicity of a peptide. FIG. 1A depicts an exemplary model of an \\u03b1-helical peptide. In the exemplary model, the distribution of polar and non-polar residues can be arranged along a helical structure such that a distribution of the polar and non-polar residues are adjusted along a face of the helix. The three exemplary models displayed include a helix that can be mostly polar, a helix with approximately equal distribution of polar and non-polar residues on opposite face of the helix, and a helix that can be mostly hydrophobic. A person of skill in the art would be capable of modulating a helix employing this principle to construct a peptide with any such distribution of polar and non-polar residues as desired.In some instances, amino acid substitutions can be carried out in order to modulate biological activity of a peptide disclosed herein. In some cases, a substitution described herein can be performed to at least maintain biological function of a peptide disclosed herein.A peptide can be designed to optimize pharmacokinetic parameters. For instance, a peptide can be designed to bear a hydrophobic and/or charged surface to increase associate with a protein, for example, serum albumin. In some embodiments, such an association can increase the resident circulatory half-life of a peptide by allowing a peptide to exceed the renal filtration size cutoff when associated with a protein, for example, serum albumin. In some cases, a peptide, salt, or metabolite thereof can at least partially associate with a protein, cell, polynucleotide or a fragment thereof. In some embodiments, a peptide, salt, or metabolite thereof can be at least partially associate with serum albumin.In some cases, a peptide can be engineered to modulate an overall length of a polypeptide described herein.

FIG. 1C(ii) shows a helix in which a polar residue can be positioned immediately prior to an aromatic residue positioned as described in FIG. 1C(i). The exemplary helix model in FIG. 1C(ii) depicts an alternating motif in which the polar residue can be positioned immediately prior to the aromatic residue every other turn of the helix, though the motif can be adjusted accordingly within the skill of a skilled artisan. FIG. 1C(iii) shows a helix in which a pair of positively-charged amino acids are place on opposite ends of a helix on the hydrophobic face of the helix. FIG. 1C(iv) shows a motif in which positively and negatively charged amino acids are positioned on the hydrophobic face of the helix in an alternating pattern, such that each turn of the helix can comprise a positively or negatively charged amino acid. FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 1C are not meant to be limiting.

Skilled artisans are aware of multiple methods for culturing recombinant cells to produce (and optionally secrete) a peptide as disclosed herein, as well as for purification and/or isolation of expressed peptide. The methods chosen for protein purification can depend on many variables, including the properties of a protein of interest, its location and form within a cell, the vector, host strain background, and the intended application for an expressed protein. Culture conditions can also have an effect on solubility and localization of a given target protein. Many approaches can be used to purify target proteins expressed in recombinant microbial cells as disclosed herein, including without limitation ion exchange and gel filtration.In some instances, a peptide fusion tag can be added to a recombinant protein. Some peptide fusion tags such as maltose-binding protein (MBP), thioredoxin (Trx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), poly-histidine, and chitin binding protein (CBP) can be utilized for a variety of affinity purification methods that take advantage of a peptide fusion tag. In some cases, the use of an affinity method can enable the purification of a target protein to near homogeneity in one step. Purification may include cleavage of part or all of a fusion tag with enterokinase, factor Xa, thrombin, or HRV 3C proteases, for example. In some instances, before purification or activity measurements of an expressed target protein, preliminary analysis of expression levels, cellular localization, and solubility of a target protein can be performed. A target protein may be found in any or all of the following fractions: soluble or insoluble cytoplasmic fractions, periplasm, or medium.Epitope fusion tags can be fused to an N- or C-terminus of a peptide described herein in order to detect protein levels of a protein through a visualization method such as western blot, immunofluorescence, or immunoprecipitation. Examples can include a VHS-tag, a Myc-tag, an HA-tag, a FLAG-tag, an NE-tag, and the like.In some cases, a fluorescent protein can be fused to an N- or C-terminus of a peptide described herein. In some cases, a fluorescent protein can be employed as a folding reporter protein in order to determine whether a particular protein scaffold is properly folded. In some cases, a fluorescent protein can be employed as a marker to allow for imaging of a fusion protein when administered to a subject. Examples can include fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), Emerald, Superfolder GFP, folding-reporter GFP, Azami Green, mWasabi, TagGFP, TurboGFP, enhanced GFP (eGFP), ZsGreen, T-Sapphire, blue-fluorescent protein (BFP), enhanced BFP (eBFP), eBFP2, Azurite, Cerulean, yellow-fluorescent protein (YFP), eYFP, Topaz, Venus, mCitrine, YPet, TagYFP, ZsYellow, PhiYFP, ZsYellow, mBanana, orange fluorescent protein (OFP), Kusabira Orange, Kusabira Orange2, mOrange, mOrange2, dTomato, mTangerine, red fluorescent protein (RFP), mRuby, mApple, mStrawberry, AsRed2, JRed, mRaspberry, dKeima-tandem, mPlum, HcRed-tandem, mCherry, mTurquoise, cyano-fluorescent protein (CFP) and the like.In some instances, a peptide disclosed herein can be synthesized chemically without the use of a recombinant production system. Protein synthesis can be carried out in a liquid-phase system or in a solid-phase system using techniques known in the art (see, e.g., Atherton, E., Sheppard, R. C. (1989).
