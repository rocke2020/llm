            "Introduction": "Peptides, polymers composed of amino acids, are known to possess versatile biological functions such as promoting cell proliferation, migration, inflammation/anti-inflammation, angiogenesis, and melanogenesis [1], which causes numerous physiological procedures in human body [2]. The first synthetic peptide incorporated into skin care products in the late 80s was copper glycine-histidine-lysine (Cu-GHK) generated by Pickard in 1973 [3]. Since then, many short synthetic peptides playing roles in inflammation, extracellular matrix synthesis or pigmentation have been developed. These peptides are used for anti-oxidation, whitening effects, “Botox-like” wrinkle smoothing and collagen stimulation. Cosmeceutical peptides usually have certain features. Historically, it has always been assumed that the molecular weight of a peptide should be less than 500 Da, if not it could not pass skin barrier [4]. In addition, the peptide should have water solubility over 1 mg/mL and have no or few polar centers in its sequence [5]. Copper tripeptides, tetrapeptide PKEK, manganese tripeptide-1, soybean peptide, black rice oligopeptides and silk fibroin peptide have been on the market for several decades, but less in vivo efficacy data is available [5]. In general, their substance mixtures are examined in cosmetic formulations, so as to the actual effect of individual peptides on the skin still remains unclear in many cases. Scientific research on peptides usually focus on identification of functional mechanism, and practical application for cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical use. In the last decade, the development of active peptides has established a new field in cosmeceutical and pharmaceutical skin care. To generate safety profile and functional data of peptide, in vivo animal test was usually chosen in the past. However, correctness of results from animal model for human skin has always been quested. This problem, using animals for testing purposes, finally leads to EU regulation (76/768/EEC, Feb. 2003), beginning in 2009, to prohibit use of animals to accumulating toxicological data for cosmetic ingredients. As an alternative solution, artificial human skin models have been established and many of these are now commercially available. Several technologies have been introduced to design and develop artificial skin models which highly simulate complex structure of human skin [6,7]. The most common skin models were epidermis models using human skin epidermal cells, including EpiSkin® (L’Oreal, Levallois-Perret, France), EpiDerm® (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA, USA), SkinEthic® (SkinEthics, Lyon, France) and epiCS® (CellSystems, Troisdorf, Germany). Recently, some advanced skin models were commercialized, including Phenion® (Henkel, Dusseldorf, Germany) and NeoDerm® (Tegoscience, Seoul, Korea). These models have been proven to replace animal tests in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries for evaluation of corrosion, skin irradiation and photo-toxicity [8]. Some of them can also be applied in basic research for clinical use [9]. Human skin gives protective, perceptive and communication functions to the body with resilient and relatively impermeable barrier. To develop agents to deliver pharmacy or active ingredients across skin tissues is a highly attractive topic in recent years. Using compounds or physical equipment to enhance cargo delivery causes some problems, for instance, skin toxicity, skin irritation, inconvenience and high costs [10,11]. Comparing with chemical or physical ways, peptide with cell or skin penetrating activity is an alternative choice. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) are peptides that can transport cargos such as chemical compounds, proteins, peptides, and nanoparticles into cells [12]. Most CPP sequences are rich in positively charged residues, and are internalized after interacting with negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and clustering on outer membrane surfaces [13]. For example, a modified PTD (Protein transduction domain) peptide from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): tat (RKKRRQRRR) has been shown to have cell membrane penetration property and deliver therapeutic proteins into mammalian cells [14]. Another case is AID (arginine-rich intracellular delivery) peptides which successfully enter and deliver functional proteins into epidermis and dermis of mouse [15,16]. Many modified AID peptides (HGH6, TAT, R7) proven to penetrate into skin of living animals with cargos [17,18]. For example, R7-CsA could reach dermal lymphocytes and inhibit cutaneous inflammation [19]. These facts indicated a new approach for increasing delivery of poorly absorbed ingredients across skin tissue barriers. Here a 10-residue peptide, covering major GAG binding motif of a human ribonuclease, is identified as a CPPAIF (anti-inflammatory CPP). CPPAIF has been shown to possess epithelial cell, GAG and lipid binding properties as well as cell penetrating activity through macropinocytosis [20,21]. Notably, CPPAIF is able to deliver small fluorescent molecules, recombinant proteins, nanoparticles, and peptidomimetic drugs into cells [20]. Based on these facts, safety and potential of CPPAIF for cosmeceutical application were examined with skin cell and 3D-skin models following the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines with special focus on stability, safety, skin irritation, skin barrier function, chemico sensitization, bio-functions and transepidermal activity in this work.",
            "Materials and Methods": "2.1. Stability Test of CPPAIF under Different Conditions: All chemicals used in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All cell lines were purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA). For dry powder stability test, CPPAIF (NYRWRCKNQN with unmodified N- and C-termini; AIF: anti-inflammation, synthesized by Kelowna International Scientific, Taipei, Taiwan) and was dissolved in water, concentration of 1 mg/mL, and then freeze and dry into powder. Samples were separately incubated in 4 and 25 °C for 1, 3 and 7 days. These tubes were collected and stored at −80 °C. For solution stability test, CPPAIF was dissolved in water to 1 mg/mL then used 0.2 μm filter filted and dispense to 100 μL in each tubes. Samples were separately incubated in specific temperatures, including −20, 4, 30 and 50 °C for 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30 and 60 days. These tubes were collected and stored at −80 °C. Then, the remainder of CPPAIF were tested with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) Separation was performed on XBridge C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, particle size 5 μm, Waters). The HPLC condition and program: A buffer is ddH2O with 0.1% TFA (trifluoroacetic acid), B buffer is acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA. The flow rate is 1 mL/min and acetonitrile gradient from 10 to 50% in 15 min and the percentage of acetonitrile raise to 100% from 16 to 20 min. 2.2. In Vitro Skin Irritation Test (OECD 439): The 3D reconstructed human epidermis tissue model: SkinEthicTM RHE (SkinEthics, Lyon, France) was used to evaluate whether CPPAIF cause skin irritation [8]. Testing procedure involved topical application of testing article (CPPAIF) to surface of epidermis and subsequent assessment of effect on cell viability. All 3D-skin tissues were incubated with growth medium for 2 h and then CPPAIF was add to final 1 mM for 42 min treatment. After treatment, testing substance was washed out by 25 times with 1 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and tissues were further incubated in growth medium for 42 h. After incubation, growth medium was substituted by maintenance medium with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) agent for 3 h incubation. Next, insert (with tissue) were washed with PBS and air dried. Formazan in tissues was extracted with isopropanol and measured by determining the OD at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (iMark Microplate Absorbance Reader, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Cell viability of treated models was normalized to the negative control, which was set to 100%. 2.3. In Vitro Skin Barrier Function Test (Developed from OECD TG 439): A test procedure was developed to test effect of CPPAIF on the barrier function on SkinEthicTM reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) based on the relevant procedure mentioned in OECD TG 439. This testing procedure involved topical application of CPPAIF onto surface of the epidermis model for 1 h. After 1 h of exposure, CPPAIF was washed by PBS from the surface followed by application of detergent solution (1% Triton X-100) onto surface of the tissue for another 2 h. Then, washed the detergent solution and AlamarBlue cell viability assay (BUF012B, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was performed for assessment of cell viability. Cell viability of treated models was normalized to the negative control, which was set to 100%. 2.4. In Chemico Skin Sensitization: Direct Peptide Reactivity Assay (DPRA) (OECD 442C): The direct peptide reactivity assay (DPRA) is an in chemico method which quantified the remaining concentration of cysteine- or lysine-containing peptide after 24 h incubation with the test chemical at 25 °C. Relative peptide concentration was measured by HPLC (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with gradient elution and UV detection (220 nm). Cysteine and lysine peptide percent depletion values were calculated for a prediction model (Table 1). This model allowed to classify the test chemical to one of four reactivity classes used to support the discrimination between sensitisers and non-sensitisers. The study is carried out according to the OECD guideline 442C (2015). 2.5. Macrophage Inflammation Assay: Macrophage inflammatory assay were carried out to evaluate whether CPPAIF displayed anti-inflammation potential [22,23,24]. In this experiment, macrophage (Raw264.7) cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 105 cells/mL) and allowed to attach overnight. After attachment, cells were incubated with various concentrations of CPPAIF for 1 h and followed by stimulation with 1 μg/mL of LPS (lipopolysaccharide). No LPS-added cells were considered as control groups. After incubation, the amount of TNF-α and IL-6 in the medium were analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (# KHC3011 and #EH2IL6, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell viability was measured by AlamarBlue cell viability assay (BUF012B, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). 2.6. Mast Cell Degranulation Assay: Inhibitory effects on release of β-hexosaminidase in RBL-2H3 (rat-basophilic leukemia cell line) were evaluated by a cell degranulation assay [25]. Briefly, 0.2 mL of 5 × 105 cells/mL RBL-2H3 cells were seed in 24-well plates (in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), streptomycin (100 μg/mL) and penicillin (100 units/mL)) and sensitized with anti-DNP IgE (0.45 μg/mL). These cells were washed with Siraganian buffer (5 mM KCl, 0.4 mM MgCl2, 119 mM NaCl, 25 mM piperazine-N,N 2-bis(2-ethane sulfonic acid (PIPES), and 40 mM NaOH, pH 7.2) with glucose, 1 mM CaCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After washing, these cell were incubated in 160 μL of the PBS for 10 min at 37 °C and then 20 μL of test sample solution or calcimycin (final 1 mM) was added and further incubated for 10 min. The plate was cooling on ice for 10 min to stop reaction. 50 μL of supernatant was transferred to 96-well plate and added with 50 μL of substrate (1 mM p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide) in 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.5) at 37 °C for 2.5 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 200 μL of carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M, pH 10.0). The value of A405 was measured with a microplate reader. 2.7. Internalization of CPPAIF in Human Keratinocyte (HaCaT): Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy (CLSM, Zeiss Cell Observer-Z1, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany) was performed to assess distribution of TMR-labeled CPPAIF (tetramethylrhodamine-NYRWRCKNQN, synthesized by Kelowna International Scientific, Taipei, Taiwan) in human keratinocytes, HaCaT. First, apply a layer of type I collagen on a glass cover slip, dry and sterilize the cover slip with UV light. Then, culture the HaCaT cells (1 × 103 per slip) on the coverslip for 16 h. The attached HaCaT cells were cultured with 20 μM of the TMR- CPPAIF for 30 min, observed with CLSM (63× oil-immersion objective lens), and photographed under same exposure conditions. 2.8. Transepidermal Measurement of CPPAIF by Reconstructed Human Epidermis Tissue Model: 3D human epidermis tissue model (SkinEthicTM RHE, SkinEthics, Lyon, France) and two kinds of CPPAIF-containing emulsion systems (water-in-oil emulsion (W/O) and oil-in-water emulsion (O/W)) were prepared for the transepidermal measurements. Formulation contents of the W/O and O/W are listed in Tables S1 and S2. All 3D-skin tissues were incubated with growth medium for 2 h and then 0.1 mL formulated CPPAIF (0.1 mM) emulsions were add to top of the tissues for 1 h treatment. After treatment liquid beneath the model was collected for HPLC quantification. Transepidermal rate was calculated by measuring the amount of CPPAIF in medium beneath the 3D model by HPLC ((concentration of the beneath liquid/concentration of the topical exposure) × 100). 2.9. Statistical Analyses: All statistical analyses were processed by GraphPad Prism version 5.01 for Windows 548 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Each value was the average of three measurements, where the presented data was the mean ± SD and all means were compared by one-way ANOVA.",
            "Results": "3.1. Stability of CPPAIF under Different Conditions: CPPAIF was incubated at a specified temperature (4 °C and 25 °C) and analyzed remaining quantity by HPLC. The molecular weight of CPPAIF was validated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The result indicated that m/z of CPPAIF was 1381.1 as expected (Figure S1). The results in Figure 1 show that CPPAIF maintained intact close to 100% in dry powder form at low temperature (4 °C) and normal temperature (25 °C) up to 1 week, indicating that preservation of CPPAIF in dry powder form could effectively prevent peptide precipitation and fragmentation. 3.1. Stability of CPPAIF under Different Conditions: CPPAIF under different solutions or temperatures was further examined to explore suitable storage condition. It was dissolved in ddH2O at different temperatures and time to examine which solution was suitable for storage. First, CPPAIF was dissolved in water at a concentration of 1 mg/mL passed through 0.2 μm filter, and incubated at different temperatures. After one week, residual quantity of CPPAIF was still more than 90% when tested at −20 °C and 4 °C, but that of CPPAIF incubated at 30 °C and 50 °C dropped to about 70% (Figure 2). Moreover, after storage for 30 days intact CPPAIF retained in solution was measured to be 81% at −20 °C, 73% at 4 °C, 36% at 30 °C, and 17% at 50 °C, indicating that CPPAIF had better stability at low temperature environment (−20 °C and 4 °C) (Figure 2). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was applied to validate the molecular weight of residual CPPAIF as shown in the signal of HPLC chromatogram (Figure S2). 3.2. Safety of CPPAIF: In vitro skin irritation testz of CPPAIF were carried out following OECD Test Guideline No. 439 (2015), using a reconstructed human epidermis test method. 3.2. Safety of CPPAIF: As shown in Figure 3, relative viability of negative control (NC, PBS), positive control (PC, 5% sodium dodecyl sulphate, SDS), and CPPAIF (1 mM) was determined to be respectively: 100.0 ± 4.8%, 1.44 ± 0.8%, and 90.3 ± 3.2%, clearly suggesting that CPPAIF (1 mM) did not cause skin irritation (no category) according to the classification of OECD 439. 3.2. Safety of CPPAIF: CPPAIF was subsequently applied to in vitro skin barrier function test (developed from OECD TG 439). A normal stratum corneum was multilayered containing essential lipid profile to produce desired functional barrier with robustness to resist rapid penetration of cytotoxic chemicals, e.g., SDS or Triton X-100. Here, a 3D human epidermis tissue model, SkinEthicTM RHE, was used for skin barrier function tests. Tissues incubated with CPPAIF (1 mM) remained cell viability over 80%, which was considered not influencing barrier function of the tissue. As shown in Figure 4, relative viability of negative control (NC, H2O), positive control (PC, 5% SDS), and CPPAIF (1 mM) was respectively 100.0 ± 6.2%, 24.0 ± 3.3%, and 95.6 ± 2.8%, evidently indicating that CPPAIF would not impair the skin barrier function of the 3D epidermis tissue model. 3.2. Safety of CPPAIF: Finally, in chemico skin sensitization of CPPAIF was tested following OECD Test Guideline No. 442C. The mean of cysteine and lysine % depletion of 100 mM cinnamaldehyde (positive control), phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, hexalene glycol, 1,3-butanediol and 0.1 mM CPPAIF was respectively calculated to be 65.07, 0.56, 2.53, 0.63, −0.12 and 0.74 (Table 2). 3.2. Safety of CPPAIF: The HPLC chromatograms for cysteine and lysine depletion quantification of CPPAIF were shown in Figure S3. The value of CPPAIF was lower than 19% and thus classified as “Non-sensitizer” according to OECD 442C like other regulatory approved cosmetic ingredients. 3.3. Bio-Function of CPPAIF: Anti-Inflammation without Sensitization: Inflammation inhibition effect of CPPAIF on macrophage cells was tested at various concentrations of 1 and 0.1 μM. As shown in Figure 5A, 0.1 μM CPPAIF inhibited 22.1 ± 1.2% TNF-α secretion and 1 μM CPPAIF showed stronger inhibition effect of 56.7 ± 2.5%. 0.1 μM and 1 μM CPPAIF also inhibited 18.3 ± 3.4% and 40 ± 4.2% of IL-6 secretion, respectively (Figure 5B). These results implied a dose-dependent relationship between the concentration of CPPAIF (from 0~1 μM) and the amount of TNF-α or IL-6 inhibition. Nevertheless, cell viability remained 85.2 ± 4.25% at CPPAIF concentration of 1 μM. Taken together, CPPAIF might be a potential ingredient with skin protectant function, especially anti-photo aging [26,27] related to the anti-inflammatory effects [28]. 3.3. Bio-Function of CPPAIF: Anti-Inflammation without Sensitization: The sensitization of CPPAIF was evaluated by mast cell degranulation assay. Here RBL-2H3 cells were treated with various concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 2, 5, 10 μM) of CPPAIF. Granule release represented by β-hexoaminidase was induced by A23187 (Calcimycin) as positive control (PC). In this experiment CPPAIF under 10 μM did not induce any mast cell degranulation release (Figure 6) while cell viability remained over 90%. This result indicated that CPPAIF would not induce any allergic effect in epidermal tissue [29]. 3.4. Cell Penetration and Transepidermal Test. of CPPAIF:: First, epidermal cell penetration activity of CPPAIF was measured in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. The cells were incubated with 20 μM TMR-CPPAIF at 37 °C for 30 min prior to observation by CLSM (Scale bar: 10 μm). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). As shown in Figure 7, after addition of 20 μM TMR-CPPAIF (tetramethylrhodamine, TMR) for 30 min, TMR signal was clearly detected in the cells (Figure 7). A strong signal accumulation in the cytoplasm showed that TMR-CPPAIF internalized into the cells. Such effect was observed while the skin barrier function still maintained well as investigated by 3D human epidermis tissue model. This result indicated that TMR-CPPAIF could penetrate skin tissue without interupting function of skin tissue. 3.4. Cell Penetration and Transepidermal Test. of CPPAIF:: After confirming the cell penetration activity of CPPAIF to normal human keratinocyte, transepidermal activity of CPPAIF in different formulations was evaluated by 3D reconstructed human epidermis tissue model. After 4 h of exposure the liquid at the bottom of the 3D model was collected and analyzed by HPLC. As shown in Figure S4, CPPAIF appeared as a sharp peak at retention time of 9 min. It was also observed that both emulsion compositions did not influence stability of CPPAIF, indicating that CPPAIF could be added to properly designed formulation as a functional cosmetic ingredient. 3.4. Cell Penetration and Transepidermal Test. of CPPAIF:: Transepidermal degree of CPPAIF was further calculated according to HPLC results. ((concentration of CPPAIF in the beneath liquid/concentration of CPPAIF in the topical exposure) * 100). As shown in Figure 8, after 4 h of exposure to the emulsions (100 μL containing 100 μM CPPAIF), CPPAIF present at the bottom of the 3D skin tissues W/O and O/W formulations was determined to be respectively 41.4 ± 3.6% and 28.4 ± 1.7% respectively in W/O and O/W formulations. The transepidermal activity of W/O CPPAIF was evidently higher than that of O/W formulation. Taken together, appropriate formulation such as W/O emulsion in this study could evidently facilitate transepidermal penetration of CPPAIF. 3.4. Cell Penetration and Transepidermal Test. of CPPAIF:: We further examined skin barrier function of the 3D model after 4 h of exposure to formulated CPPAIF. As shown in Figure 9, appropriate W/O formulations promoted CPPAIF penetration into stratum corneum while at the same time maintained the robustness barrier function of the epidermis. The 3D models incubated with W/O CPPAIF showed a higher relative cell viability of 76.5 ± 8.5% than O/W CPPAIF formulation (43.3 ± 7.8%). Relative cell viability of negative control (NC, H2O) equaled to 100.0 ± 9.6%. Thus, W/O CPPAIF displayed a better transepidermal degree with slight disruption effect on disruption of skin barrier function.",
            "Discussion": "Since 2000 the application of peptides in cosmeceutical products has rapidly increased, and this trend has sped up research and knowledge of physiological properties of peptides. Now, researchers have identified peptide sequences for penetration into skin layers or different cosmetic activities (e.g., anti-ageing, antioxidant, whitening) [2]. The commercial potential for these bio-functional peptides is high, especially for peptides with excellent stability and no toxicity. Many peptides were reported to have different cosmetic activities, but some clinical study results about these peptides were obtained using formulations containing peptides and other active ingredients. These trials did not clearly differentiate the role of peptide from other actives in the formulation. Hence, the results could not be claimed clearly to be the effect of the peptides for skin benefits [2]. Here CPPAIF was tested with regulatory affair approved methods and clear formulations, therefore the safety datum and anti-inflammatory activity were highly credible. CPPAIF in W/O or O/W formulation could pass through 3D human tissue model. Our CPPAIF showed skin penetration activity without disrupting skin barrier function, and its anti-inflammatory activity might alleviate slight inflammation caused by conventional transepidermal methods [2]. As a CPP, this peptide could also carrier cargos into epidermal cell in skin tissue. Skin tissue is composed by four different layers: stratum corneum, viable epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous connective tissue [30]. This structure efficiently blocks penetration of extraneous molecules in to deeper tissue. It has been reported that TAT can be apply for topical drug-delivery, but high cell penetrating activity might increase some risks which is that TAT might bring drug penetrating cell-layers into deeper tissues [30]. Unlike TAT, our CPPAIF only penetrate into cytosol of epidermal cells without exocytosis property [21], hence it would not be a concern of drug effect. Environmental conditions of skin surface might be tough for bio-molecules (peptide). Cream formulation could provide a stable environment for cosmetic ingredients and remained longer on the skin surface. Some cosmeceutical peptides were also applied in cream formulation [2]. To reduce these challenges that might disrupt stability of CPPAIF, our strategy was applied peptide with W/O or O/W formulation as a mimic of cream in transepidermal test. This standard cosmetic formulation might prove a relatively stable condition for CPPAIF and slightly enhance transepidermal activity. Taken together, CPPAIF itself has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for cosmeceutical use. Comparison between W/O and O/W formulations revealed that the former was more suitable for further application, and the latter with reduced skin barrier function presumably due to formulation components, which might be improved with alternative composition or process. With these facts, CPPAIF was convinced to be a perfect choice for carrying active ingredients through skin tissue and that will be our next goal.",
            "Conclusions": "CPPAIF, a GAG binding peptide, could penetrate cell membranes with cargos in living animals and was proven to be stable in powder form under room temperature or in water solution under −20 °C using HPLC analysis. Following OECD guidelines, CPPAIF was evaluated and characterized without skin irritation, skin sensitization and did not disrupt skin barrier function using 3D skin model. In addition to high safety CPPAIF was identified to inhibit inflammation by decreasing inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6, using macrophage model. With this bio-function, CPPAIF was further proven to not have sensitization effects. The result of penetration test in HaCaT cells verified CPPAIF for cargo (TMR in this case) delivery into cell in less 30 min. Finally, two commonly used formulations were applied to evaluate transepidermal activity of CPPAIF in 3D skin model in order to imitate real cosmetic applications, and W/O formulation of CPPAIF was identified as a better choice to efficiently penetrate 3D skin with slight disruption of skin barrier function."

        "abstract": "Cosmeceutical peptides have become an important topic in recent decades in both academic and industrial fields. Many natural or synthetic peptides with different biological functions including anti-ageing, anti-oxidation, anti-infection and anti-pigmentation have been developed and commercialized. Current cosmeceutical peptides have already satisfied most market demand, remaining: \"cargos carrying skin penetrating peptide with high safety\" still an un-met need. To this aim, a cell-penetrating peptide, CPPAIF, which efficiently transported cargos into epithelial cells was exanimated. CPPAIF was evaluated with cell model and 3D skin model following OECD guidelines without using animal models. As a highly stable peptide, CPPAIF neither irritated nor sensitized skin, also did not disrupt skin barrier. In addition, such high safety peptide had anti-inflammation activity without allergic effect. Moreover, cargo carrying activity of CPPAIF was assayed using HaCaT cell model and rapid CPPAIF penetration was observed within 30 min. Finally, CPPAIF possessed transepidermal activity in water in oil formulation without disruption of skin barrier. All evidences indicated that CPPAIF was an ideal choice for skin penetrating and its anti-inflammatory activity could improve skin condition, which made CPPAIF suitable and attractive for novel cosmeceutical product development.",

            "Background": "In critically ill patients, acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the leading causes of acute respiratory failure and have a high mortality ratio [1]. The characteristics of ARDS and ALI are mainly the complex relationship between the immune system and alveolar capillaries, leading to acute pro-inflammatory reactions [2], accompanied by increased pulmonary protein permeability, enhanced pulmonary edema, slowed alveolar clearance, and ultimately impaired gas exchange and hypoxemia [3–5]. The current main therapeutic strategies are supportive treatments [6], including lung-protective ventilation [7], prone positioning [8], early neuromuscular blockade [9], and conservative fluid management [10]. However, the therapeutic effect was not significantly improved [7], and effective treatment strategies are urgently required. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been identified as a cause of ALI [11], which could directly damage endothelial cells and indirectly activates neutrophils and macrophages to exert toxic effects on pulmonary [12]. Recently, using of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the treatment of ALI has proven to be effective [13]. They secrete paracrine factors that regulate lung endothelial and epithelial permeability, including growth factors, antimicrobial peptides, and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which could alleviate damaged alveolar fluid clearance, improve lung permeability, and mitigate inflammatory disorders [14–18]. In addition, MSCs are widely available and can be collected from the bone marrow [19], adipose tissues [20], placenta [21], umbilical cord [22], and other tissues [23, 24]. However, inflammatory stimulation in the ALI lung microenvironment could lead to a decrease in MSC survival and weaken paracrine capacity [24]. Several studies have been reported to identify strategies to ameliorate and improve the efficiency of MSC therapy [13, 14, 25]. Glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) is an endogenous 30-amino acid peptide synthesized by enteroendocrine L cells and secreted throughout the small intestine and ascending colon which influence the absorption of nutrients [26]. Liraglutide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide analog that targets the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) [27]. Studies have shown that liraglutide has a good anti-inflammatory function and could regulate the inflammatory response to limit the progression of atherosclerosis in vivo [28]. In addition, it was reported that liraglutide could treat myocardial infarction by increasing myocardial blood flow, inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and enhancing cardiac function [29]. It has also been found in our previous research that liraglutide can be combined with MSCs to alleviate the symptoms of ALI [30]. Based on above investigation, we aimed to contrast the comparison of human chorionic villus-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hCMSCs), human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs), and human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) under the action of LPS and liraglutide. The protective effects of three MSCs combined with liraglutide on ALI animal models were examined simultaneously. Furthermore, we assessed the anti-apoptotic effect of liraglutide on MSCs by activating the PKA/β-catenin pathway to suppress the Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3 apoptotic signaling pathways.",
            "Methods": "Cell culture and transfection: hCMSCs and hBMSCs were characterized by staining with antibodies against CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD34, and CD45 and then detected by flow cytometry as described in our previous study [31]. hAMSCs were kindly provided by Dr. Chuandong Wang (Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China) and were verified by staining with antibodies against CD34, CD45, CD73, CD90, and CD105 and then detected by flow cytometry as described in Wang’s article [32]. MSCs were cultured in mesenchymal stem cell medium (ScienCell, Cat. No. 7501, USA) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. MSCs were harvested at approximately 80–90%, and the culture medium was changed every 2–3 days. Cell culture and transfection: Cells were seeded onto desired size plates to reach 70–90% and then transfection was performed using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11668027, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The si-GLP-1R were synthesized by Hanbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The sequences are as follows: Cell culture and transfection: Hs-GLP-1R-si-1 Cell culture and transfection: 5′-GGAAGACUGUCAACACUAAdTdT-3′; 5′-UAGAAAUCUAUCUUUGUCCdTdT-3′; Cell culture and transfection: Hs-GLP-1R-si-2 Cell culture and transfection: 5′-GAAUAGUCUGUGUGCACAAdTdT-3′;5′-UUGUGCACACAGACUAUUCdTdT-3′; Cell culture and transfection: Hs-GLP-1R-si-3 Cell culture and transfection: 5′-GGAAGGAUGUGCUUUCCUAdTdT-3′; 5′-UAGGAAAGCACAUCCUUCCdTdT-3′; Cell culture and transfection: Negative control (NC) Cell culture and transfection: 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGdTdT-3′; 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAdTdT-3′. Cell culture and transfection: The Si-GLP-1R silencing efficiency was determined 48 h post transfection by protein and mRNA analysis for future experiments. MTT assay: MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to detect cell viability of three different MSCs. The three MSCs were at 1 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates and then divided into three groups: (i) no treatment (control group), (ii) treated with 30 μg/mL LPS (L2880, Sigma, USA) (LPS group), and (iii) treated with 30 μg/mL LPS and 10 nM liraglutide (MK, Cat. No. 204656-20-2, China) (LPS + liraglutide group). The concentrations of LPS and liraglutide were selected based on previous studies of MSCs viability [30]. After 6, 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation, 10 μL of 5 mg/mL MTT (M2128, Sigma, USA) solution was added to each well and continued to culture at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were lysed using 100 μL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 67-68-5, Sigma, USA). The optical density (OD) was measured at both 492 nm and 630 nm wavelength. Date represents the mean of four wells at each point. Western blot assay: To verify the expression of KGF, SPC, GLP-1, and GLP-1R, MSCs were exposed to 30 μg/mL LPS or 10 nM liraglutide. To verify the PKA/β-catenin pathway, MSCs were exposed to 10 nM liraglutide or 100 nM SiRNA or 20 μM PKA inhibitor H89 (MCE, Cat. No. 130964-39-5, USA) on the premise of exposure to 30 μg/mL LPS. Proteins were extracted from differently treated MSCs. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (CST, #7780, USA). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gel ahead of being transferred on PVDF membranes (Life Technologies, USA). The PVDF membrane was blocked in 5% BSA solution for 3 h, after which the different primary antibodies were applied overnight including Angiopoietin 1 (Ang-1, Abcam, ab102015,UK), GLP-1R (Novus, NBP1-97308, USA), SFTPC (SPC, Abclonal, A1835, USA), KGF (Abcam, ab131162 UK), p-β-catenin (Santa Cruz, sc-57535, USA), β-catenin (Wanleibio, WL0962a, China), cleaved caspase-3 (Abcam, ab49822,UK), cleaved caspase-9 (Abways, CY5682, Chian), Bax (Wanleibio, WL03446, China), and Bcl-2 (Abways, CY6717, China). GAPDH (Santa Cruz, sc-166574, USA) was used as a loading control of total protein. The membranes were then incubated with HRP secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 111-035-003, 115-035-003, China). The blots were detected by ECL technique. RT-qPCR assay: Total RNA was extracted from three different MSCs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596-026, USA). TransScript First-Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (Transgene Biotech, AH341-01, China) was used for cDNA synthesis following the manufacturer’s instruction. The RT-qPCR was carried out on an CFX96 (Bio-Rad, USA) and TransStart Top Green qPCR SuperMix (Transgene Biotech, AQ131-01, China) with a gene-specific primer (Table 1). The relative expression of gene was expressed as a function of threshold cycle (Ct) and analyzed by 2-ΔΔCt method.\n The sequence of primers F:5′- ATCACAGTGGCGAGAGGAGAG-3′ R: 5′-CCAAGTGATGCAAGCAGAGG-3′ F: 5′-GGGTCATCCAGGCAACTCGG-3′ R: 5′-CTTTCCCGTTGGGGCTTCC-3′ F: 5′-GACAGCAGACACGGAACTCT-3′ R: 5′-AGTCGTCGCTCTTTCCAAACT-3′ F: 5′-TGGCTTGGATGTGCAACCTT-3′ R: 5′-CCCCCTCAAAGAAAGCGTTTG-3′ F:5′-TGCCAAATATGATGACATCAAGAA-3′ R:5′- GGAGTGGGTGTCGCTGTTG-3′ Immunofluorescence staining: The 1 × 105 MSCs were plated in a 24-well plate, after treatment with LPS and liraglutide, hCMSCs, hBMSCs, and hAMSCs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (solarbio, P1110, China) at 4 °C for 20 min, washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS, and then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton× 100 (Sigma, 9002-93-1, USA) at room temperature. The cells were incubated with anti-GLP-1R antibody at 5 μg/mL overnight at 4 °C and detected with anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 111-165-003, China) (red) 1:100 dilution. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma, 28718-90-3, USA) (blue). MSCs were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan). MSCs were imaged using a × 10 objective. Randomly, they selected 8 fields of view for quantitative fluorescence analysis. Immunohistochemistry analysis: The pulmonary tissue sections were incubated at 60 °C for 4 h and immersed in xylene twice for 20 min each, rehydrated by means of a graded series of ethanol, and then incubated with fresh 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in 100% methanol for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were then washed three times using PBS for 15 min. Antigen retrieval was performed with the ImmunoSaver antigen retriever system (Boster, AR0023, USA) at 98–100 °C for 30 min, and sections were cooled to room temperature. Sections were then washed by PBS. Nonspecific binging sites were blocked by incubation with BSA solution (Boster, SA1022, USA) for 30 min. The sections were then incubated with SFTPC antibody (Abclonal, A1835, USA) or Nanog antibody (Thermo Fisher Science, PA1-097, China) in a 1:100 dilution overnight at 4 °C and incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 30 min. The sections were performed according to the steps of the SABC immunohistochemical staining kit (Boster, SA1022, USA). The sections were imaged using a × 40 objective. TUNEL analysis: The TUNEL experiment (Beyotime, C1088, China) follows the instructions. The 1 × 105 MSCs were plated in a 24-well plate, divided into control groups, 30 μg/ml LPS groups and 30 μg/mL LPS combined with 10 nM liraglutide groups, and cultured for 72 h. The MSCs were washed once with PBS, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (solarbio, P1110, China) for 30 min at 4 °C, and later incubated with 0.3% Tritonx-100 (Sigma, 9002-93-1, USA) for 5 min at room temperature. After washing twice using PBS, the TUNEL solution (Beyotime, C1088, China) was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in the dark. Afterwards, it was washed 3 times with PBS. DAPI (Sigma, 28718-90-3, USA) was incubated the nuclei in the dark at room temperature for 10 min. MSCs were imaged using a × 20 objective. Flow cytometric analysis: MSC apoptosis were performed by an Annexin V-FITC/propidiumiodide (PI) kit (4A Biotech, FXP018, China). MSCs were collected using different treatments and prepared 50 μL of a 2 × 105 cell suspension in PBS. The MSCs were then incubated with Annexin V-FITC and PI for 5 min at room temperature and analyzed using a FACS Vantage cytometer (Becton Dickinson, USA). The proportion of apoptotic cells was analyzed by FlowJo software. In vivo modeling: Four-week-old male SPF BALB/C mice were purchased from Cavensbiogle (Suzhou, China). The mice were kept in a conducive environment and, within a week, had adapted to it and able to freely access food and water. Mice were originally divided into nine groups (twelve mice per group): (i) PBS + PBS group, (ii) LPS + PBS group, (iii) LPS + liraglutide group, (iv) LPS + hCMSCs group, (v) LPS + hBMSCs group, (vi) LPS + hAMSCs group, (vii) LPS + hCMSCs+Liraglutide group, (viii) LPS + hBMSCs + liraglutide group, and (ix) LPS + hAMSCs + liraglutide group. After LPS stimulation, six mice were randomly selected from each group and classified into the 2d model group and 7d model group. In the LPS + PBS group, mice were slowly instilled via the trachea with 2.5 mg/kg LPS (dissolved in 50 μL of 0.9% normal saline). The PBS + PBS group were injected with the same volume of 0.9% normal saline. The LPS + liraglutide group was injected with the same volume of LPS, and 20 min later, it was intraperitoneally injected 2 mg/kg liraglutide every 12 h. The LPS + hCMSCs group, LPS + hBMSCs group, and LPS + hAMSCs group were injected with the same volume of LPS which then 4 h later, 200 μL PBS containing 5 × 105 different MSCs were injected into the tail vein. The LPS + hCMSCs + liraglutide group, LPS + hBMSCs + liraglutide group, and LPS + hAMSCs + liraglutide group were treated the same way as the LPS + hCMSCs group, LPS + hBMSCs group, and LPS + hAMSCs group. After 20 min of treatment, 2 mg/kg of liraglutide was intraperitoneally injected every 12 h (4 times in 2d model group and 14 times in 7d model group) [33]. All animals were humanely killed by lethal overdose of sodium pentobarbital in 2d and 7d model group after LPS stimulation. The animal experiment flow chart is shown in Fig. 1.\n Animal experiment flow chart. Human chorionic villus-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hCMSCs), human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs), human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) H&E staining: After 2d or 7d of LPS stimulation, mice were sacrificed and their pulmonary tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, embedded in paraffin, sectioned into 3–5 μm thickness, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E, Cat. No.C0105, Beyotime). The pathological changes of pulmonary tissues were observed under a microscope using × 20 objective. According to the pulmonary tissue pathological damage score [34], the researchers were blinded to the group and randomly selected 10 fields of view in the × 400 field of view, with each variable being scored with 0 to 4 points. The scoring criteria were as follows: no injury scored 0, injury in 25% of the field scored 1, injury in 50% of the field scored 2, injury in 75% of the field scored 3, and injury throughout the field 4. Total protein concentration and inflammatory cell counts in the BALF: After 2d or 7d of LPS stimulation, we collected the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and the supernatant was centrifuged to determine the total protein concentration by the BCA protein kit (CST, #7780, USA). The total number of nucleated cells in the BALF was counted using a hemocytometer. The pellet was then resuspended in 200 μL PBS. Ten microliters of cell suspension was added to the coverslip and stained with Wright-Giemsa staining solution (Solarbio, G1020, China); 200 cells were counted under 8 randomly selected fields using a microscope of × 100 magnification. Wet-to-dry ratio (W/D): After 2d or 7d of LPS stimulation, mice were sacrificed and their lungs were collected. The severity of pulmonary edema was assessed by the wet-to-dry ratio (W/D). The left lower lung was weighted and then dehydrated at 60 °C for 72 h in an oven. ELISA assay: In vitro, three kinds of MSCs were seeded with 30 μg/mL LPS alone or with 10 nM liraglutide after 72 h. The culture media were collected and detected for the secretion of IL-10 (Neobioscience, Cat. No. EMC005, China) and TGS-6 (RayBio, Cat. No. P98066, China). The BALF collected and detected the levels of Ang-1 (Dakewe, Cat. No. 100-170-APH, China) and KGF (Dakewe, Cat. No. KOA0490, China) following the instruction of the ELISA kits. Statistical analysis: All experiments were repeated at least three times. Quantitative results were expressed as the means ± standard deviation (SD). The comparison between SiRNA-control and SiRNA-GLP-1R was examined using the Student’s t test with SPSS 22.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Comparisons among multiple groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s post hoc test and Mann-Whitney test using GraphPad Prism 5.02 software. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.",
            "Results": "Expression of GLP-1R in three MSCs at different time points stimulated by LPS: Figure 2 showed the expression of GLP-1R in three MSCs under LPS stimulation. The protein expression of GLP-1R in three MSCs was analyzed by western blot and it decreased gradually with the increase of LPS stimulation time (Fig. 2a). Correspondingly, the ratio of GLP-1R/GAPDH was significantly reduced (Fig. 2b). The level of GLP-1R in hCMSCs was higher than that of hBMSCs and hAMSCs. GLP-1R at mRNA level was detected by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2c). The results showed that the level of GLP-1R was decreased under the stimulation of LPS, and it was higher in hCMSCs. The fluorescence area and mean intensity were showed the same results (Fig. 2d–g).\n Expression of GLP-1R in three MSCs at different time points under the stimulation of LPS. a–c The expression of GLP-1R in hCMSCs, hBMSCs, and hAMSCs in the control group and in 30 μg/mL LPS stimulation for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h at protein or mRNA level.

Blue stands for DAPI and red stands for GLP-1R protein. The representative pictures were showed at × 10 original magnification. Scale bars, 200 μm, and error bar represent mean ± SD from three independent experiments. Compared with the control group corresponding to MSCs, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001; compared with the hCMSCs group corresponding to time points, +P < 0.05, ++P < 0.01, and +++P < 0.001; compared with the hBMSCs group corresponding to time points, #P < 0.05 Expression of Ang-1, SPC, KGF, and cytokines and proliferation of three MSCs under the stimulation of LPS and liraglutide: Under the stimulation of LPS, the levels of cytokines IL-10 and TNF-α-stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) were reduced, and the degree of inflammation is enhanced. Under the action of liraglutide, the levels of IL-10 and TSG-6 were increased, which reduces the level of inflammation (Additional file 1). To verify whether liraglutide could raise the expression of Ang-1, SPC, and KGF at protein or mRNA level, western blot and RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression at 72 h (Fig. 3a–d). The expression of KGF was higher in hCMSCs, the expression of Ang-1 was higher in hBMSCs, and the expression of SPC was more in hAMSCs. In order to compare the proliferation of three MSCs under the action of LPS and liraglutide, we observed the growth state of three MSCs by MTT assay. Under the stimulation of LPS, the proliferation of three MSCs decreased at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h. Conversely, liraglutide could significantly enhance MSC growth under LPS stimulation (Fig. 3e–g).\n The expression of Ang-1, SPC, and KGF under the stimulation of LPS alone and combination of liraglutide for 72 h in three MSCs. a Ang-1, SPC, KGF, b Ang-1, c SPC, and d KGF are expressed at protein or mRNA level under the stimulation of 30 μg/mL LPS alone and combination of 10 nM liraglutide at 72 h.

The expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 was increased after LPS stimulation for 72 h, and it reversed by addition of liraglutide. The apoptosis of three MSCs was observed by flow cytometry (Fig. 4b–d). Apoptosis ratio increased significantly after MSCs was cultured in LPS-containing medium for 72 h. hCMSCs were most apoptotic MSCs under the stimulation of LPS. Liraglutide could reduce the percentage of apoptosis. The TUNEL experiment further examined the apoptosis of the three MSCs (Fig. 4e–g). The results were consistent with flow cytometry results. hCMSCs had bright green fluorescence intensity under LPS stimulation.\n Comparison of the effects of three MSCs on apoptosis under the conditions of LPS alone and combination of liraglutide. a Expression of cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3 proteins in three MSCs stimulated by 30 μg/mL LPS alone and combination of 10 nM liraglutide. b Flow cytometry experiments showed the apoptosis of three MSCs in the control group, LPS group, and LPS + liraglutide group as well as the proportion of no apoptotic cells (c) and apoptotic cells (d). TUNEL staining images for the apoptosis of hCMSCs (e), hBMSCs (f), and hAMSCs (g) in the control group, LPS group, and LPS + liraglutide group. Blue represented DAPI and green represented protein apoptosis. The representative pictures were showed at × 20 original magnification, scale bars, 100 μm. Error bars represent mean ± SD from three independent experiments. Compared with the control group corresponding to MSCs, ***P < 0.001; compared with the LPS group corresponding to MSCs, +++P < 0.001; compared with the corresponding treatment group with hCMSCs, ##P < 0.01 and ###P < 0.001; compared with corresponding treatment group with hBMSCs, $$$P < 0.001 Liraglutide inhibits hCMSCs apoptosis through PKA/β-catenin pathway: To certify the mechanism of liraglutide exerting anti-apoptotic function, we selected hCMSCs with obvious apoptosis as our target cells by flow cytometry and TUNEL assay (Fig. 4b, e–g). Since the classical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in MSCs, we investigated whether it could participate in the effect of liraglutide on apoptosis of hCMSCs. Liraglutide acted on GLP-1R and we validated the effects of liraglutide by synthesizing exogenous small interfering RNA (SiRNA). Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to analysis of the efficiency of three SiRNA transfections into hCMSCs (Fig. 5a, b), and the Si-3 with the most obvious effect was chosen.\n Liraglutide reduces apoptosis of hCMSCs via PKA/β-catenin pathway. a Western blot and b RT-qPCR verify the knockdown effects of three Si-GLP-1R in hCMSCs. c, d Western blot was used to detect of β-catenin and p-β-catenin expression under the stimulation of LPS by adding 20 μM H89 or 100 nM Si-GLP-1R and liraglutide. e The expression of apoptotic proteins Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3 was detected by western blot with PKA inhibitor H89 and liraglutide. f The expression of GLP-1R and apoptotic proteins Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3 were detected by western blot with Si-GLP-1R and liraglutide. Error bars represent mean ± SD from three independent experiments. Compared with Si-con group, ***P < 0.001 Liraglutide inhibits hCMSCs apoptosis through PKA/β-catenin pathway: Western blot showed that the expression of phosphorylated β-catenin (p-β-catenin) by adding Si-GLP-1R was attenuated, the expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3 were heightened, and the expression of Bcl-2 was decreased, indicating an increase in apoptosis (Fig. 5d, f). Liraglutide inhibits hCMSCs apoptosis through PKA/β-catenin pathway: After the addition of liraglutide, hCMSC apoptosis could be reversed. Simultaneously, we used PKA inhibitor H89 to verify MSC apoptosis. The results showed that H89 inhibited the expression of p-β-catenin and increased the expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3, further reducing the expression of Bcl-2 (Fig. 5c, e). An addition of liraglutide could reduce the apoptosis of hCMSCs. The effects of three MSCs alone and combination of liraglutide on acute lung injury in vivo: H&E staining of lung sections was performed for histological evaluation of the ALI models. We observed in 2d model group that in the PBS + PBS group, the pulmonary tissues were arranged neatly and the alveolar cells were uniform in size. Conversely, in the LPS + PBS group, it was evident that the alveolar septum is increased, the alveolar cavities were severely hemorrhagic, and inflammatory cells infiltrated. In the three MSCs alone groups, the degree of lung injury could be alleviated. However, in the liraglutide alone group, the recovery of lung injury was less effective than the MSCs alone. Simultaneously, in the MSCs combined with liraglutide groups, the extent of lung injury was more pronouncedly relieved and the lung injury scores were reduced (Fig. 6a, b). Same trends were also shown in the 7d model group (Additional file 2). And we could conclude that the treatment recovery effect of the 7d model group was preceded than the 2d model group, and hCMSCs combined with liraglutide has a certain advantage in relieving ALI symptoms than the combination liraglutide of hBMSCs or hAMSCs.\n Comparison of the consequence of liraglutide alone, three MSCs alone, and combination of liraglutide in ALI models. a The lung tissue sections were observed by H&E staining for histological after 2d of LPS stimulation. The representative sections were showed at × 20 original magnification. b Lung injury score, c lung wet-to-dry, and d total protein concentration in BALF were assessed. e Total cells, f macrophages, and g neutrophils in BALF were assessed by Wright-Giemsa composite dyeing stain counting. Each group contains 6 mice. Error bars represent mean ± SD from three independent experiments. Scale bars, 100 μm. Compared with the PBS + PBS group, ***P < 0.001; compared with the LPS + PBS group, +P < 0.05, ++P < 0.01, and +++P < 0.001; compared with the corresponding MSC group, #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, and ###P < 0.001 The effects of three MSCs alone and combination of liraglutide on acute lung injury in vivo: Total protein concentration in BALF and lung wet-to-dry ratio are two major indicators for assessing pulmonary edema. In the 2d model group, the total protein concentration and wet-to-dry ratio of the LPS + PBS group were significantly higher than those of the PBS + PBS group. Contrary, the total protein concentration and wet-to-dry ratio were decreased in the three MSCs alone groups and liraglutide alone group. In the three MSCs combined with liraglutide groups, the reduction effect was more obvious. Among them, hCMSCs combined with liraglutide reduced the total protein concentration and wet-to-dry ratio more than hBMSCs and hAMSCs (Fig. 6c, d). The number of total cells, neutrophils, and macrophages in BALF was evidently increased in the LPS + PBS group compared with the PBS + PBS group. Among the three MSCs alone groups and liraglutide alone group, the number of cells lessened. There is significant inflammatory cell reduction in the combination MSCs of liraglutide groups (Fig. 6e–g). The 7d model group also showed the same results (Additional file 3). At the same time, in the 7d model group, the recovery of lung injury was brightly greater than that in the 2d model group. There is significant improvement in acute lung injury symptoms in mice. Influence of MSCs alone and combination of liraglutide on the expression of SPC, Ang-1, and KGF in vivo: SPC is a protein marker of alveolar type II cells (AEC2s). Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of SPC. In the 7d model group, it was observed that the expression of lung sections is increased in the three MSCs alone groups and liraglutide alone group, and the expression was more notable in three MSCs combined with liraglutide groups (Fig. 7a). In addition, by examining the expression of Nanog protein [35] in the 2d model group, it was found that the expression of Nanog protein increased under the action of liraglutide (Additional file 4). ELISA assay was used to detect the levels of Ang-1 and KGF in BALF. It was found that in the 2d and 7d model groups, the levels of Ang-1 and KGF in the LPS + PBS groups were significantly lower than those in the PBS + PBS groups. Although, the concentration was increased in the three MSCs alone groups and liraglutide alone group, the liraglutide alone group was not as effective as the three MSCs alone groups. The increase was more pronounced in the combination of three MSCs of liraglutide groups; moreover, hCMSCs combined with liraglutide has certain advantages over liraglutide combined with hBMSCs or hAMSCs (Fig. 7b, c).\n Expression of SPC, Ang-1, and KGF in ALI models. a The expression of SPC in lung sections after 7d of LPS stimulation by immunohistochemistry. Brown intracellular precipitation represents SPC protein. The expression of Ang-1 (b) and KGF (c) in BALF after LPS stimulation for 2d and 7d were detected by ELISA assay. Each group contains 6 mice. Error bars represent mean ± SD from three independent experiments. Scale bars, 50 μm. Compared with the PBS + PBS group, ***P < 0.001; compared with the LPS + PBS group, ++P < 0.01 and +++P < 0.001; compared with the corresponding MSC group, ##P < 0.01 and ###P < 0.001",
            "Discussion": "It was reported in preclinical studies that MSCs from different sources have distinct immunomodulatory and biological functions [13, 14, 16, 18]. hCMSCs belong to the placenta-derived MSCs and are considered to be alternative source of mesenchymal stem cells [36]. Since hCMSCs are readily obtained, they have superior immunomodulatory functions compared with hBMSCs and hAMSCs [37]. Although hBMSCs are widely used adult stem cells, the cell number and multidirectional differentiation potential of these cells were still affected with aging, which limits their availability in the clinical setting [38].. hAMSCs are an emerging candidate for stem cell therapy because of their similar capabilities and differentiation potential to hBMSCs [39]. Some studies have comparatively analyzed the differential properties and biological function of MSCs derived from human chorionic villus, human bone marrow, and human adipose. Although MSCs from different source share similar antigens, their repair potential for ALI is different. Fewer studies have so far investigated their therapeutic effect difference on ALI. In MSC phase I clinical trial, intravenous MSCs was well tolerated in 9 patients with ARDS, and no serious adverse events were reported with MSC administration after 6 months [40]. Subsequently, a double-blind, randomized trial was conducted in a phase II clinical trial, and 60 eligible patients were selected. No side effects associated with MSCs were found in the trial. However, in the experiment, it was found that the survival rate of MSCs is low, only fluctuating between 36 and 85% [41]. Due to the short survival rate of MSCs in the ALI model, we found that combined treatment of MSCs is more evident than MSC alone [42–44]. Previous researches have shown that in addition to being effective in glycemic control, GLP-1 could also perform distinct functions in other tissues [28]. GLP-1 has been shown to exert anti-apoptotic effects in several cells, such as nerve cells [45] and cardiomyocytes [46]. Liraglutide is a long-acting agonist of GLP-1, and it has been reported that liraglutide could inhibit cell apoptosis, including renal tubular epithelial cells [47] and osteoblasts [26]. In our previous research, we also found that MSCs combined with liraglutide can alleviate the inflammation to some extent and reduce the symptoms of ALI [30]. Taking previous studies into account, we explored whether liraglutide could play a role in treatment of ALI by inhibiting MSCs apoptosis. In this study, we tested the expression of GLP-1R, SPC, KGF, and Ang-1 in hCMSCs, hBMSCs, and hAMSCs under the action of LPS and liraglutide. We found that the expression of Ang-1, SPC, and KGF are enhanced after adding liraglutide. KGF is considered to be an eventful paracrine soluble factor in MSCs and could stimulate the division of ATII in vivo and in vitro [48]. Ang-1 is a key endothelial survival and vascular stabilizing factor. Recent studies have shown that Ang-1 secreted by MSCs could be responsible for inhibiting pulmonary edema and restoring vascular integrity [49]. SPC is a crucial component of pulmonary surfactant and plays an essential role in the regulation of inflammation. Researches have shown that SPC may affect the microenvironment in bronchoalveolar lavage [50, 51]. Hereafter, we detected whether liraglutide could alleviate the symptoms of ALI by reducing MSC apoptosis. Flow cytometry and TUNEL experiments showed that the apoptosis of three MSCs stimulated by LPS is obvious. The addition of liraglutide reversed the apoptosis of MSCs. Then, we verified whether it could inhibit apoptosis by PKA/β-catenin signaling pathway. The expression of apoptotic proteins was examined by the addition of the PKA inhibitor H89 or Si-GLP-1R. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that forms a dimer with proapoptotic protein Bax, which could stimulate the expression of apoptotic protein cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3 [52, 53]. H89 and Si-GLP-1R could decrease Bcl-2 expression and increase Bax, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3 expression by inhibiting p-β-catenin expression. Conversely, the addition of liraglutide reversed these results; the expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3 were reduced; and Bcl-2 was increased. The results indicated that liraglutide could reverse LPS-induced apoptosis by restoring the balance of Bcl-2 protein family and caspase protein family (Fig. 8).\n Schematic showing the regulation of apoptosis in MSCs through the PKA/β-catenin pathway. Liraglutide stimulated the expression of PKA by targeting GLP-1R and then motivated the expression of β-catenin, thereby attenuating the expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3 and enhancing the expression of Bcl-2, consequently reducing the apoptosis of MSCs In an in vivo experiment with ALI, we compared the liraglutide alone, three MSCs alone, and combination of liraglutide to observe their repair function. In previous studies, MSCs have been shown to repair ALI [13–16, 19], and liraglutide could alleviate the inflammatory environment of ALI [27–29]. In our study, by measuring total protein concentration and cell counts in BALF, wet-to-dry ratio, H&E staining, and lung injury scores, we conclude that liraglutide or MSCs alone and combination of liraglutide could ameliorate the symptoms of ALI. In particular, through the comparison of three MSCs, it was found that hCMSCs combined with liraglutide have a relative advantage in the recovery of symptoms in ALI mice. This trend was also observed in SPC immunohistochemistry experiment as well as the concentration of Ang-1 and KGF. However, the increased expression of SPC in lung tissues may be due to themselves or the secretion of AEC2s stimulated by MSCs. The specific mechanism is unknown, and further investigation is needed.",
            "Conclusions": "Based on our research, we concluded that the effect of MSC combination of liraglutide was prioritized to MSCs or liraglutide alone in the treatment of ALI. Through the PKA/β-catenin signaling pathway, liraglutide could reduce the apoptosis of MSCs. Simultaneously, the degree of lung injury could be ameliorated by increasing the expression of Ang-1, SPC, and KGF, thereby alleviating the symptoms of ALI."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nARDS and ALI are life-threatening diseases with extremely high mortality in patients. Different sources of MSCs could mitigate the symptoms of ALI from diverse mechanisms. Liraglutide is an activator of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) that activates anti-apoptotic pathways and exerts anti-inflammatory effects. We mainly compared the effects of human chorionic villus-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hCMSCs), human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs), and human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) on the treatment of ALI and explored the apoptosis mechanism of combination MSCs of liraglutide.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe proliferation of MSCs was detected by MTT assay. Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression of GLP-1R, SPC, Ang-1, and KGF in MSCs stimulated by LPS and liraglutide. By using flow cytometry and TUNEL assay to compare the apoptosis of three MSCs under the action of LPS and liraglutide, we selected hCMSCs as the target cells to study the expression of apoptotic protein through the PKA/β-catenin pathway. In ALI animal models, we observed the effects of liraglutide alone, MSCs alone, and MSCs combined with liraglutide by H&E staining, cell counting, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe demonstrated that LPS attenuates the proliferation of the three MSCs and the expression of GLP-1R. Liraglutide could reverse the effects of LPS; increase the expression of SPC, Ang-1, and KGF; and can reduce the apoptosis of three MSCs through the PKA/β-catenin pathway. In the LPS-induced ALI model, MSCs combined with liraglutide showed a significant therapeutic effect, and hCMSCs combined with liraglutide have advantages in the treatment of ALI.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe therapeutic effect of combination MSCs of liraglutide on ALI was higher than that of MSCs alone or liraglutide alone, and liraglutide could alleviate the symptoms of ALI by reducing MSCs apoptosis.",

            "Introduction": "Chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders hallmark and drive the pathogenesis and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, irreversible cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma 1-3. Dyslipidemia initiates the onset of NAFLD and exacerbates the inflammation, damage and ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes 3, 4. Upon the lipotoxic stimulation, inflammatory macrophages are activated and mediate the inflammatory response and hepatic injury 5. Macrophages display phenotypic and functional plasticity and undergo inflammatory M1 polarization or anti-inflammatory M2 polarization under specific pathologic conditions 6. Inflammatory M1 macrophages are the predominant phenotype in NAFLD/NASH, secrete several proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and promote the progression of hepatic steatosis to NASH, fibrosis and cirrhosis. Interestingly, M2 macrophages release anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-10), attenuate hepatic injury and promote tissue repair 7. Timely switch of macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 phenotype may determine the resolution of hepatic inflammation in NAFLD/NASH. The phenotypes and functions of macrophages are tightly associated to the metabolic status 8, 9. The metabolism of M1 macrophages is signatured by the hyperactivation of fatty acid synthesis, glycolysis, lipid uptake and pentose phosphate pathway, and the suppression of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and mitochondrial respiration 10. By contrast, the metabolism of M2 macrophages is characterized by fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial respiration 11, 12. Glycolysis is tightly regulated for generating ATP and biosynthetic intermediates. Pyruvate kinase (PK) is one of the regulatory enzymes in glycolysis and catalyzes the phosphate transfer from phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP to yield pyruvate and ATP 13. Unlike other isoforms, PKM2 plays a key role in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells and activated immune cells 14, 15. On the other hand, PKM2 may be phosphorylated and translocated to the cell nucleus, and thereby regulate the transcriptional activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) in the induction of inflammatory factors and glycolytic enzymes (e.g., GLUT1, LDHA) 15, 16. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of PKM2 could effectively ameliorate inflammation via reducing the production of lactate, the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and the formation of inflammasome 16. Importantly, it was recently demonstrated that PKM2 was greatly expressed in the livers, especially in hepatic macrophages of NAFLD and NASH patients 17. Thus, PKM2 may be a promising target for therapeutic intervention in NAFLD and NASH. Pharmacological approaches have been evaluated for skewing macrophage polarization from M1 to M2 phenotype 18. Natural product pentacyclic triterpene celastrol exhibits a spectrum of pharmacological activities against chronic diseases and demonstrates the best potency against obesity 19, 20. Importantly, celastrol appears to be effective for treating metabolic disorders in obesity, diabetes, NAFLD and NASH 21. Several previous studies suggest that celastrol may target different molecular mechanisms as follows: 1) to increase leptin sensitivity by reducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress 22 and inactivating the NF-kB pathway 23; 2) to promote energy expenditure and mitochondrial function by activating HSF1-PGC1α transcriptional axis 24; 3) to alleviate inflammation by suppressing Nur77 mediated autophagy 25; 4) to promote weight loss via improving antioxidant capacity and lipid metabolism 26, 27. Along this line, we previously reported that celastrol might ameliorate inflammation in obese mice via reducing macrophage M1 polarization 28. Presumably, celastrol targets different signaling pathways via interacting with the relevant protein targets 21, 29. On the other hand, celastrol possesses the quinone methide moiety with the possibility to covalently modify various protein targets. The recently emerged chemical biology approaches may support the identification of celastrol-bound proteins as the therapeutic targets for developing anti-NAFLD drugs. In the present study, celastrol-PEG3-azide was synthesized and immobilized onto alkyne-coated agarose resin under click chemistry condition for the pulldown of celastrol-bounds proteins. We further investigated the role of the celastrol-bound proteins in reprogramming macrophage polarization in the mouse model of NAFLD/NASH.",

HRMS (m/z): [M+ H] + calcd. for C37H55N4O6, 651.4122; found 651.4005. Identification of celastrol-bound proteins: Covalent celastrol-protein conjugates were isolated and identified as outlined in Fig. 1A using the Click-&-Go Dde Protein Enrichment Kit (Click Chemistry Tools). Briefly, the alkyne agarose resin was coated with azide-PEG3-amine or celastrol-PEG3-azide under click chemistry reaction conditions with copper catalyst. For the preparation of the cellular proteins, RAW264.7 cells (total 10 dishes) were stimulated with LPS and subsequently lysed with RIPA buffer containing proteinase inhibitors. After vigorous centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and desalted by passing through PD-10 column from GE Healthcare. The cellular proteins were incubated with azide-PEG3-amine- or celastrol-PEG3-azide-coated agarose resin at 4 °C overnight, separated by centrifugation, washed 4 times with washing solution and eluted with 2% hydrazine. The protein fractions were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or immunoblotted with antibodies against PKM1 or PKM2. The celastrol-bound proteins were identified as previously described 30. Preparation of recombinant PKM1, PKM2 and mutated PKM2 (C31S) protein: The full length cDNAs encoding PKM1 and PKM2 were cloned from pLHCX-Flag-mPKM1 (Plasmid #42511, Addgene) and pLHCX-Flag-mPKM2 (Plasmid #42512, Addgene) by PCR technique using forward primer: 5'- GTACGAATTCATGCCGAAGCCACACAGT-3'; reverse primer: 5'- GTACCTCGAGTCAAGGTACAGGCACTACAC-3'. Following cleavage with restriction enzymes XhoI and EcoRI, the PCR products were respectively ligated into bacterial expression vector pET-28a with T4 DNA ligase. For the generation of mutated PKM2 (C31S) plasmid, the point mutation was achieved using Mut Express II Fast Mutagenesis Kit V2 (Nanjing Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd) with forward primer 5′-GGACATGTGTTCCAGGAAGGTGTCAGCCATGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCCTGGAACACATGTCCCGCCTGGACATTGACTCTG-3′. The construction of expression plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing at BGI Hong Kong Company Limited (Hong Kong, China). The cDNA constructs were introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells while the bacterial colonies were examined for transformation. For protein expressions, the best E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformants were induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 30 °C for 6 h. The recombinant proteins were purified with a HisTrapTM HP column under the control of AKTAexplorerTM chromatography system from GE Healthcare. The recombinant protein fractions were combined and stored at -80 °C until use. Validation of covalent celastrol-PKM2 conjugate: Celastrol-PEG3-biotin was prepared and characterized as previously described 30. For detecting the binding of celastrol to PKM2 or mutated PKM2 (C31S), the recombinant proteins in HEPES buffer were treated with excessive celastrol-PEG3-biotin or celastrol at 4 °C for overnight and then detected by western blot (WB) analysis. The covalent celastrol-PKM2 conjugate was detected with HRP-Conjugated streptavidin and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent, while the protein input was assessed by WB analysis using anti-PKM2 antibody. Proteomic identification of celastrol-bound peptides: Celastrol (30 μg) was incubated with recombinant PKM2 protein (40 μg) in HEPES buffer (10 mM, containing 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% DMSO, pH 7.8) at 4 °C overnight. The reaction mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. The protein band was recovered and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. The peptides were desalted by Ziptip C18 resin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS method as previously described 30. Molecular docking: The crystal structure of PKM2 (4B2D) was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org). Covalent docking of celastrol to the structure of PKM2 was performed with the software AutoDock 4 as previously described 31. With the two-point attractor method, celastrol was modeled as a free ligand, while aa optimal potential was used to bring together the quinone methide moiety of celastrol and the amino acid residue Cys31 in PKM2. The celastrol-PKM2 conjugate was visualized by PyMOL (hppt://www.pymol.org) and Molecular Operating Environment (MOE, https://www.chemcomp.com/Products.htm). Assay for the enzymatic activities of PKM1 and PKM2: The recombinant PKM1 or PKM2 was incubated with celastrol at the indicated concentrations. At the end of reaction, the enzymatic activities of PKM1 and PKM2 were assayed using BioVision pyruvate kinase activity colorimetric/fluorometric assay kit and presented as a percentage compared to the vehicle-treated controls. The IC50 value was calculated by a sigmoidal dose-response curve on GraphPad Prism software. Visualization of the covalent celastrol-PKM2 conjugate in macrophage cells: Celastrol-PEG4-Alkyne was prepared and characterized as previously described 30. For in vitro formation of covalent celastrol-PKM2 conjugate, the cells were treated with celastrol-PEG4-Alkyne or celastrol for 2 h. The cellular deposition of celastrol was traced by click chemistry labeling with AFDye555-picolyl azide whereas the cellular PKM2 was visualized by immunofluorescence staining. The intracellular localization of PKM2 and the deposition of celastrol were imaged by Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscopy (Carl-Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Flow cytometry: After drug treatment, RAW264.7 cells were firstly stained with anti-CD86 antibody. For the detection of CD206, the cells were fixed and permeabilizated with Cytofix/CytopermTM Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (BD Biosciences). The cells were subsequently stained with anti-CD206 antibody. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on NovoCyte Quanteon Flow Cytometer from Agilent Technologies. Data were analyzed with NovoExpress Software. Seahorse assay for glycolytic and mitochondrial functions: Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of live cells were examined with Seahorse XF Glycolysis Stress Test Kit and Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit on Agilent Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer. RAW264.7 cells were seeded at the density of 8000 cells per well in XFe96 cell culture microplates. For ECAR analysis, 10 mM glucose, 1.5 μM oligomycin, 100 mM 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) were sequentially injected into each well. For OCR measurement, 1.5 μM oligomycin, 2.5 μM FCCP and 2.5 μM rotenone/antimycin A were sequentially injected. The data were analyzed and normalized against the cell counts using the Seahorse XFe Wave software. Preparation of cellular/hepatic proteins, cytosolic and nuclear proteins: The cellular/hepatic proteins were extracted using the same method as previous described 30. The cytosolic and nuclear proteins were isolated using commercial extraction reagents. Briefly, the cells were lysed with ice-cold cytoplasmic extraction reagent for 10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were recovered as the cytosolic proteins, whereas pellets were suspended in ice-cold nuclear extraction reagent for 40 min and centrifuged to recover the supernatants as the nuclear proteins. Western blot (WB) analysis: The cellular proteins (20-30 μg) or hepatic proteins (60 μg) were separated by 8-12% SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. After blocking with 5% BSA in TBST solution at 4 °C overnight, the blots were probed with specific primary antibodies and detected with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were detected by ECL detection reagents. Immunofluorescence staining: For immunofluorescence staining of RAW264.7 cells, the procedures were performed as previously described 30. For immunofluorescence staining of liver tissues, the livers were collected from the experimental mice, fixed in 4% PFA and dehydrated in 30% sucrose in PBS. After frozen at -20 °C, the liver tissues were cut into the sections at 12 μm thickness. The liver sections were subjected to antigen retrieval, permeabilization and blocking as previously described 30. The tissue slices were then incubated with primary antibodies against F4/80, iNOS, arginase-1 and PKM2 and then incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies. The cell nuclei were detected with DAPI. The cells or the liver sections were imaged on the confocal microscopy. Co-immunoprecipitation: After drug treatment, RAW264.7 cells were lysed by RIPA buffer. The PKM2-HIF-1α complex was isolated with PKM2 antibody on protein A/G PLUS-agarose overnight. Non-specific rabbit IgG antibody was used as negative control. The pulldown proteins were examined using WB assay with anti-HIF-1α antibodies. The cell lysates were detected with anti-PKM2 antibodies as the index of protein loading. Animal experiments: The animal experiments were performed following the guidelines of the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research of the University of Hong Kong. The NAFLD model was established by feeding mice with high fat diet (HFD) as previously described 32. In brief, male C57BL/6N mice (3~4 weeks, 11-13 g) were fed with 60 kcal% HFD for consecutively 12 weeks, whereas the control mice were fed on chow diet. For the drug treatment, celastrol was dissolved in saline containing 5% DMSO and 1% Tween-20. Celastrol (3.5 mg/kg/d) was orally administrated to the HFD mice for 21 consecutive days. After drug treatment, the mice were weighed daily. On the final day of drug administration, mice were analyzed for the fat contents and lean contents as previously described 33. The serum samples were collected for the analysis of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ATL) using the commercial diagnostic reagent kits from Stanbio Laboratory. Tissue staining by Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain, Oil Red O stain and Picrosirius Red stain: On the final day of drug administration, the tissues were collected and examined by H&E staining, Oil Red O staining and Picrosirius Red staining as previously described 33, 34. In brief, hepatic tissues were fixed in 4% PFA, embedded in paraffin and cut into the sections. Paraffin-embedded sections were dewaxed, rehydrated and stained with H&E stain or Picrosirius Red stain. For Oil Red O staining, the livers were fixed in 4% PFA, dehydrated in 30% sucrose. After frozen at -20 °C, the liver tissues were cut into the sections at 12 μm thickness. The liver sections were incubated in 0.2% Oil Red O reagent for 20 min. The images were acquired on Olympus BX43F light microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR): The hepatic total RNAs were isolated with TRIzol reagent and reversely transcribed to the cDNAs with commercial cDNA synthesis kit. The mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines were determined by qRT-PCR with the specific primers and SYBR Green mix from QIAGEN on the LightCycler® 480 System from Roche Diagnostics International AG (Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The mRNA levels of different biomarkers were normalized against the mRNA levels of β-actin. Statistical analysis: The results were expressed as mean ± SD for all experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test or two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak test with GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA, USA). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.",
            "Results": "PKM2 was determined to be predominant celastrol-bound protein: A small molecule probe celastrol-PEG3-azide was synthesized to isolate celastrol-bound proteins through the procedure as outlined in Fig. 1A. Celastrol-PEG3-azide was coupled to alkyne-coated agarose resin with a cleavable linker via click chemistry cycloaddition reaction. The celastrol-coated agarose resin was then incubated with cellular proteins isolated from LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells to allow the covalent binding to occur. The covalently bound proteins were released from the agarose resin by hydrazine-mediated cleavage. After separating by gel electrophoresis and visualizing by Coomassie blue dye, the protein bands were recovered, digested by trypsin and identified by MALDI-TOF-MS technology. PKM2 was identified as a predominant celastrol-bound protein from the 55-70 kDa protein band (Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 1B and Fig. S2A, WB analysis with specific antibodies showed an evident signal for PKM2 while no signal for PKM1 in the same protein band. These results suggested that celastrol preferentially formed covalent conjugate with PKM2 rather than PKM1. Celastrol covalently modified PKM2 and diminished the enzyme activity: To visualize the covalent binding of celastrol to PKM2 with the biotin-streptavidin detection system, celastrol-PEG3-biotin was synthesized as a small molecule probe while the biotin tag was detected by WB analysis with HRP-streptavidin. As a result, celastrol-PEG3-biotin was readily conjugated to PKM2 and detected by WB analysis (Fig. 1C). However, such biotin detection was fully prevented by a ten-fold excess of free celastrol, supporting the stable covalent linkage between celastrol and PKM2 by nature. To identify the amino acid residues for covalent attachment by celastrol, we incubated celastrol with recombinant PKM2 and analyzed the protein complex by LC-MS/MS technique. The peptide with the sequence of GSEFMPKPHSEAGTAFIQTQQLHAAMADTFLEHMC31R was modified by celastrol (Fig. 2A). Specifically, the Cys31-containing fragments from y3 to y33 were accordingly increased by the mass of 450.61 Da for celastrol, suggesting the residue Cys31 as the attachment site for celastrol. Subsequently, we performed covalent docking using the AutoDock Tools to simulate the binding mode between celastrol and PKM2 (PDB ID: 4B2D). As a result, celastrol formed a covalent bond with the residue Cys31 in the crystal structure of PKM2 (Fig. 2B). To confirm Cys31 as the attachment site for celastrol, wild type PKM2 and mutant PKM2 (C31S) were parallelly incubated with celastrol-PEG3-biotin and detected by WB analysis. As a result, the mutant PKM2 (C31S) showed markedly less celastrol binding (Fig. S3). To examine the cellular celastrol-PKM2 conjugate, celastrol-PEG4-alkyne was synthesized as a small molecule probe. After the treatment with the probe or free celastrol, RAW264.7 cells were incubated with AFDye555-picolyl azide for the detection of the conjugate celastrol. In parallel, the cellular PKM2 was detected by immunostaining with primary anti-PKM2 antibody and fluorescent secondary antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, the labeling of the conjugate celastrol was well co-localized with the fluorescence signal of PKM2 with the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85. These results indicated that celastrol could bind to the cellular PKM2. To examine the effect of celastrol on the enzyme activities of PKM1 and PKM2, recombinant PKM1 and PKM2 were respectively incubated with celastrol at several different concentrations. The enzyme activity was subsequently assayed by commercial kit. As shown in Fig. 2D, celastrol dose-dependently diminished the enzymatic activity of PKM2. Specifically, the covalent binding of celastrol caused the decline of PKM2 activity with the IC50 value of 0.305 mM. Interestingly, celastrol did not inhibit the activity of PKM1 even at the concentration of 0.5 mM (Fig. S2D). These results suggested that celastrol might selectively target PKM2. Celastrol induced metabolic reprogramming from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation in LPS-activated macrophages: To determine the effects of celastrol on metabolic status in macrophages, RAW264.7 cells were stimulated by LPS to undergo M1 polarization and co-treated with celastrol at indicated concentrations. As shown in Figs. 3A-3B, LPS stimulated aerobic glycolysis and glycolytic capacity, whereas celastrol significantly decreased the stimulatory effects of LPS even at the concentration of 0.05 μM. On the other hand, as shown in Figs. 3C-3D, LPS challenge reduced the basal and maximal respiration of RAW264.7 cells whereas celastrol dose-dependently antagonized the effects of LPS on OCR. These results showed that celastrol suppressed aerobic glycolysis while enhanced oxidative phosphorylation in LPS-induced macrophages. Secondly, glucose consumption and lactate level were determined by commercial kits. As shown in Fig. 3E, celastrol dose-dependently reduced glucose consumption and lactate production in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Thirdly, WB analysis confirmed that LPS increased the expression of several glycolytic enzymes (i.e., GLUT1, HK-2, PKM2, LDHA), whereas celastrol dose-dependently suppressed the stimulatory effects of LPS on glycolytic biomarkers (Figs. 3F-3G). Interestingly, neither LPS nor celastrol did affect the expression of PKM1 in RAW264.7 cells (Figs. S2B-C). Fourthly, we investigated the effects of celastrol on potential signaling pathways. As shown in Figs. 3H-3I, LPS increased the levels of p-AKT, p-mTOR and HIF-1α, whereas celastrol dose-dependently reduced the HIF-1α expression and the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR. These results indicated that celastrol might inhibit Warburg effects through suppressing AKT-, mTOR- and HIF-1α-mediated signaling pathways. Celastrol inhibited the nuclear translocation of PKM2 and HIF-1α and skewed macrophage polarization from M1 to M2: To determine the effects of celastrol on PKM2 function, firstly, we examined the nuclear translocation of PKM2 by immunofluorescence staining. As a result, LPS upregulated PKM2 expression level and increased the nuclear translocation of PKM2 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, celastrol reduced both the overall and the nuclear level of PKM2 expression. Secondly, we prepared and analyzed the expression levels of cytosolic and nuclear proteins. As results, LPS significantly promoted the nuclear levels of PKM2 and HIF-1α, whereas celastrol dose-dependently decreased the LPS-induced nuclear translocation of PKM2 and HIF-1α (Figs. 4B-4C). Thirdly, we performed immunoprecipitation assay to examine the effect of celastrol on the binding of PKM2 to HIF-1α. As a result, LPS promoted the binding of PKM2 with HIF-1α, whereas celastrol at the concentration of 0.1 μM abolished the formation of PKM2 with HIF-1α (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, to examine the potential relevance to macrophage polarization, we treated RAW264.7 cells with LPS and with or without celastrol, stained with M1 biomarker CD86 or M2 biomarker CD206 and analyzed the cells by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 4E, LPS increased CD86 expression in macrophages from 18.92% (untreated control) to 30.54%, whereas celastrol dose-dependently decreased the population of CD86+ cells. On the other hand, LPS reduced the population of CD206+ macrophages from 73.19% (untreated control) to 56.96%, whereas celastrol dose-dependently increased the population of CD86+ cells. These results indicated that celastrol suppressed the nuclear translocation of PKM2 and HIF-1α and skewed the phenotypic switch of macrophages from M1- to M2-type. Celastrol ameliorated HFD-induced NAFLD in C57BL/6 mice: To investigate the efficacy of celastrol on NAFLD mice, we fed C57BL/6 mice with HFD to induce NAFLD and subsequently administrated with celastrol (Fig. 5A). Firstly, as shown in Fig. 5B, celastrol markedly reduced the body weight of NAFLD mice. Secondly, as shown in Fig. 5C, celastrol profoundly decreased the fat contents of NAFLD mice while recovered the lean contents. Thirdly, as shown in Fig. 5D, celastrol reduced serum contents of TC, AST and ALT in NAFLD mice except for the serum TG levels. Fourthly, the effects of celastrol on hepatic lipid deposition and inflammatory cell infiltration were evaluated by staining with H&E stain, Oil Red O dye and Picrosirius Red stain. As shown in Fig. 5E, H&E staining showed that HFD greatly caused adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammatory cells infiltration in the liver, whereas celastrol effectively attenuated hepatic adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammatory cell infiltration. In addition, Oil Red O staining confirmed that celastrol ameliorated lipid deposition in liver. Picrosirius Red staining indicated that HFD promoted the synthesis of deposition of collagen in liver, whereas celastrol eliminated the deposition of collagen. These results showed that celastrol reduced adipose hypertrophy, inflammatory cells infiltration and hepatic fibrosis in the NAFLD mice. Celastrol skewed hepatic macrophage M1/M2 polarization in NAFLD mice: To examine the effects of celastrol on macrophages polarization in NAFLD mice, we detected a panel of macrophage polarization biomarkers and inflammatory biomarkers. Firstly, HFD increased the number of iNOS+ M1 macrophages, while decreased the number of ARG1+ M2 macrophages. Interestingly, celastrol reduced the number of iNOS+ M1 macrophages, while increased the number of ARG1+ M2 macrophages (Fig. 6A). Secondly, based on qRT-PCR analysis for pro-inflammatory macrophage M1 biomarkers (i.e., iNOS, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, CCL-2, CXCL-10) and anti-inflammatory macrophage M2 biomarkers (i.e., ARG1, IL-10) in Fig. 6B, celastrol markedly reduced the HFD-induced the upregulation of macrophage M1 biomarkers, while elevated the levels of macrophage M2 biomarkers. Thirdly, according to WB analysis for several representative macrophage M1/M2 biomarkers in Figs. 6C-6D, celastrol remarkably ameliorated HFD-disrupted expression of macrophage M1/M2 biomarkers at the protein level. These results suggested that celastrol skewed hepatic macrophage M1/M2 polarization in NAFLD mice. Celastrol inhibited Warburg effect via targeting PKM2 in NAFLD mice: To further investigate the effects of celastrol on the metabolism and glycolysis-related signaling pathway in NAFLD mice, firstly, we employed immunofluorescence staining to examine the expression of PKM2 in hepatic macrophages in NAFLD mice. As shown in Fig. 7A, PKM2 was greatly expressed in the livers, especially in hepatic macrophages of NAFLD mice, whereas celastrol treatment effectively decreased PKM2 expression in hepatic macrophages. Secondly, the in vivo effects of celastrol on the expression of glycolysis-related proteins (i.e., PKM2, p-AKT, GLUT1 and HIF-1α) were examined by WB analysis. As shown in Figs. 7B-7C, celastrol remarkably suppressed the HFD-induced increase of expression of glycolysis-related enzymes and signaling proteins. These results consistently supported that celastrol might ameliorate the pathological alterations in NAFLD mice through inhibiting Warburg effect and skewing macrophage M1/M2 polarization through targeting PKM2.",
            "Discussion": "Macrophage polarization has recently emerged as an important therapeutic target against various metabolic diseases including insulin resistance, NAFLD and atherosclerosis 35. Our previous studies demonstrated that natural product celastrol effectively skewed macrophage M1/M2 polarization in experimental obesity 28. Here, we identified PKM2 as a molecular target for celastrol through an affinity pulldown procedure as outlined in Fig. 1A. PKM2 is one of the regulatory enzymes in glycolysis and appears to be highly associated with Warburg effect in the proliferating cancer cells and inflammatory immune cells 14. These results stimulated us to hypothesize that celastrol might induce the reprogramming of metabolism and inflammatory response via covalent modification of PKM2. Thus, celastrol may be a potential drug candidate for the resolution of inflammation and the amelioration of adipocyte hypertrophy in the mouse model of NAFLD. PKM2 is well-known to form dimer or tetramer in response to endogenous and exogenous stimuli 36. PKM2 tetramer at the compact state (R-state) exhibits high PK activity for transferring of phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to ADP, whereas PKM2 tetramer at the loose state (T-state) is less stable and likely collapses into PKM2 dimer/monomer. PKM2 dimer/monomer exhibits low PK activity and tends to translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene transcription. Importantly, several allosteric regulators bind to PKM2, induce the changes in the spatial conformation and the electrostatic force of the protein, and further affect the transition state of PKM2 36. As an example, phenylalanine could stabilize the inactive T-state tetrameric conformer and inhibit PKM2 (M2PYK) activity, whereas thyroid hormone (triiodo-L-thyronine, T3) stabilized the inactive PKM2 monomer 37. Such unique adaptive capacity of PKM2 is also tightly regulated by three cysteine residues (i.e., Cys31, Cys424 and Cys358) to show different spatial conformations and enzymatic activity 38. Under oxidative stress, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) induces the oxidation of Cys358 and diminishes PKM2 activity, triggering pro-survival signals in cancer cells 38. Several synthetic and natural compounds products (e.g., gliotoxin, resveratrol, shikonin, vitamin K, naphthoquinone C3k and C3f) exhibit anti-cancer activity via inhibiting PKM2 and modulating glycolysis 39-42. These small molecules may inhibit PKM2 activity via non-covalent or covalent binding to the active site of PKM2. Small molecules including shikonin and synthetic benzoxepane derivatives could suppress the proliferation of cancer cells and regulate macrophage polarization via covalent binding to PKM2 16, 43. Plant-derived micheliolide covalently bound to Cys424, promoted the formation of PKM2 tetramer and suppressed the cancer cells growth and tumorigenesis 44. On the other hand, celastrol is well-documented for suppressing inflammation and lipid accumulation via regulating macrophage polarization 21. Celastrol bears quinone methide moiety and may readily form a covalent bond with the cysteine residues in various proteins including Cdc37, IKKβ, Yap1 and HSP90 co-chaperone p23 29. In this study, firstly, PKM2 was determined to be a predominant celastrol-bound protein from RAW264.7 cells through affinity pulldown with celastrol-coated agarose resin (Fig. 1B), while celastrol could not bind to the cellular PKM1 protein (Fig. S2A). Secondly, we prepared recombinant mouse PKM2 protein and verified the covalent binding of celastrol to PKM2. In practice, a biotin tag was incorporated to celastrol to yield celastrol-PEG3-biotin as small molecule probe. In the presence of excessive un-tagged celastrol, the detection of celastrol-PEG3-biotin was fully prevented, proving the formation of covalent conjugate (Fig. 1C). Thirdly, peptide mapping revealed that celastrol formed covalent conjugate with the residue Cys31 (Figs. 2A-2B), whereas mutated PKM2 (C31S) showed markedly less celastrol binding (Fig. S3). Fourthly, small molecule probe celastrol-PEG3-alkyne was consistently colocalized with PKM2 in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2C). Fifthly, celastrol concentration-dependently inhibited PKM2 activity (Fig. 2D) while did not affect PKM1 activity (Fig. S2D). Celastrol appeared to support the formation of PKM2 tetramer in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells (Fig. S4). Covalent modification of Cys31 by celastrol may alter the spatial conformation of PKM2, trap PKM2 tetramer in the inactive T-state and possibly affect the binding of PEP to PKM2. Collectively, these results confirmed that celastrol could be a covalent inhibitor for PKM2. PKM2 is the key target to regulate the cellular metabolism and inflammatory response 15. The PKM2 activity is an index of Warburg effect and determines the phenotypes and functions of macrophages within the specific pathological context. PKM2 is activated to increase glycolysis in tumors and LPS-stimulated macrophages whereas inhibition of PKM2 might reduce lactate production and alleviate inflammation 14. Hyperactive PKM2 facilitates aerobic glycolysis to generate energy and spare lipids in the storage in M1 macrophages. In contrast, inhibition of PKM2 forces macrophages to switch aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP and undergo M2 polarization 9, 45. In the present study, we employed LPS to stimulate macrophage M1 polarization and induce inflammatory response. Subsequently, celastrol was evaluated for the effects on glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, inflammatory biomarkers and macrophage polarization biomarkers. Indeed, celastrol effectively reduced glucose uptake, lactate production and the expression of pivotal glycolytic proteins (i.e., GLUT1, HK-2, PKM2, LDHA) while promoted the mitochondrial respiration in LPS-challenged RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 3). Accordingly, flow cytometric analysis confirmed that celastrol skewed macrophage polarization from inflammatory M1 phenotype to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype in LPS-challenged RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 4E). As for molecular mechanisms, the Akt and mTOR signaling pathways are implicated in regulating macrophage metabolism and activation 46. Akt activation upregulates several glycolytic enzymes (e.g., GLUT1, PFKFB3 and LDHA) and thereby enhances glucose utilization 10. The activation of the Akt-mTOR axis modulates multiple downstream effectors to govern macrophage polarization 46-49. Moreover, transcription factor HIF1α also has significant role in regulating glycolysis through the transcriptional induction of several glycolytic enzymes 50. Interestingly, PKM2 could translocate to the nucleus, form complex with HIF1α and facilitate HIF1α to regulate the expression of inflammatory factors and glycolytic enzymes 15. Several previous studies demonstrated that celastrol could regulated macrophage functions by suppressing the activation of NF-κB and MAPKs and/or promoting macrophage M2 polarization 28, 51, 52. The present study showed that celastrol reduced LPS-induced activation of ATK, mTOR and HIF1α (Figs. 3H -3I), suppressed the LPS-induced nuclear translocation of PKM2 and HIF1α (Figs. 4A, 4B-4C) and prevented LPS-induced formation of PKM2-HIF1α complex (Fig. 4D). These results indicated that celastrol might induce metabolic reprogramming and skew macrophage M1/M2 polarization via targeting the cross-talks among the Akt-mTOR-HIF1α-PKM2 pathways. Macrophages play significant roles in the onset and progression of NAFLD 5. Our in vitro studies indicated that covalent inhibition of PKM2 might be a key mechanism underlying the role of celastrol on the reprogramming of metabolic networks and inflammatory response in macrophages. It is important to evaluate the pharmacological potential of celastrol for treating NAFLD. Indeed, NAFLD mouse model was induced by feeding mice with HFD for three months and subsequently received celastrol for consecutive 21 days as outlined in Fig. 5A. We found that celastrol reduced body weight in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). NMR determination showed that celastrol reduced body fat while increased lean mass (Fig. 5C). Moreover, celastrol effectively ameliorated the histopathological alterations of NAFLD. Specifically, celastrol decreased the serum levels of cholesterol, ALT and AST, hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammatory cells infiltration and hepatic fibrosis (Figs. 5D-5E). Furthermore, the effects of celastrol on macrophage polarization were examined in NAFLD mice in a great detail. Celastrol effectively reduced the expression of inflammatory M1 macrophage biomarkers while enhanced the expression of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage biomarkers (Figs. 6A-C). The immunofluorescence staining results further indicated that celastrol effectively reduced the protein level of PKM2 in hepatic macrophages (Fig. 7A). WB analysis confirmed that celastrol decreased the expression of glycolytic enzymes (i.e., GLUT1, PKM2) and the key signaling proteins (i.e., p-Akt, HIF1α) in liver of NAFLD mice (Figs. 7B-7C). These results consistently supported that celastrol might ameliorate the pathological alterations in NAFLD mice through inhibiting Warburg effect and skewing macrophage M1/M2 polarization in Akt- and HIF1α-dependent manner.",
            "Conclusion": "Covalent inhibition of PKM2 effectively suppressed Warburg effect in inflammatory macrophages and skewed macrophages M1/M2 polarization. The key finding was that celastrol induces metabolic and inflammatory reprogramming via covalently binding to PKM2, thereby parallelly suppressing glycolysis and inhibiting the activities of the PKM2-HIF-1α signaling pathway in the induction of glycolytic enzymes and inflammatory mediators. Therefore, the covalent inhibition of PKM2 is a new mechanism of celastrol to reprogram metabolic and inflammatory pathways in hepatic macrophages against NAFLD/NASH. Supplementary figures and table.

        "abstract": "Warburg effect of aerobic glycolysis in hepatic M1 macrophages is a major cause for metabolic dysfunction and inflammatory stress in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Plant-derived triterpene celastrol markedly inhibited macrophage M1 polarization and adipocyte hypertrophy in obesity. The present study was designed to identify the celastrol-bound proteins which reprogrammed metabolic and inflammatory pathways in M1 macrophages. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) was determined to be a major celastrol-bound protein. Peptide mapping revealed that celastrol bound to the residue Cys31 while covalent conjugation altered the spatial conformation and inhibited the enzyme activity of PKM2. Mechanistic studies showed that celastrol reduced the expression of glycolytic enzymes (e.g., GLUT1, HK2, LDHA, PKM2) and related signaling proteins (e.g., Akt, HIF-1α, mTOR), shifted aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and skewed macrophage polarization from inflammatory M1 type to anti-inflammatory M2 type. Animal experiments indicated that celastrol promoted weight loss, reduced serum cholesterol level, lipid accumulation and hepatic fibrosis in the mouse model of NAFLD. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that celastrol might alleviate lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis in the liver via covalent modification of PKM2.",

            "Introduction": "Diabetes mellitus is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally, and the burden of this disease has not been adequately addressed by the development of therapeutics. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia. It is caused by insulin resistance, which is impaired insulin action in target tissues, and insufficient secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells [1]. The pro-longed synergy of hyperglycemia with other metabolic abnormalities in patients with diabetes can lead to organ damage and, ultimately, disabling and life-threatening consequences [2]. In the practical approach to managing patients, biguanides, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are usually utilized with the risks of heart failure, hypo-glycemia, renal impairment, and weight gain [3]. Consequently, research institutions and pharmaceutical companies throughout the world have worked on developing new, and safer anti-T2DM targets to produce better-tolerated antidiabetic medications. Apart from being vital sources of energy, free fatty acids (FAs) also function as signaling molecules that control insulin secretion and sensitivity, inflammation, body weight, and various other metabolic processes [1]. Especially, the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 FAs) have been thoroughly documented due to their physiological function in stimulating insulin and gut hormone secretion, improving insulin sensitivity, anti-inflammatory effects, increasing glucose uptake, preventing metabolic disorder, and enabling homeostasis of healthy fat tissue [2]. The medium- to long-chain free fatty acids, including linoleic acid (LA), eicosatrienoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are known as endogenous ligands of G-protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) and G-protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120). GPR40, also known as free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFA1), is a GPR that is primarily expressed in β-cells of the pancreas and enteroendocrine L-cells and functions to modulate glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and insulin secretion when binding with its ligands. It has been shown that endogenous ligands or synthetic agonists control the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent way, contrary to insulin, sulfonylureas, and other widely used drugs, having minimal risk of hypoglycemia or other side effects [3,4,5]. Along with GPR40 expressed in pancreatic β-cells and enteroendocrine L-cells, GPR120, known as free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFA4), is also highly expressed in mature adipocytes and macrophages [6,7,8]. In addition to stimulating GLP-1 secretion from enteroendocrine cells, GPR120 expression in adipocytes and macrophages is reported to enhance glucose uptake and promote insulin sensitivity [9]. A recent study further revealed that the activation of GPR120 in mice induced brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity and promoted white fat browning [10]. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ agonists, especially the representative compounds, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), alleviate hyperglycemia by effectively increasing glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity and improving insulin resistance [11,12,13]. However, strong PPARγ agonists such as TZDs have limited clinical use due to side effects such as weight gain [14], edema [15], bone damage [16], and heart failure [17,18,19]. Recently, Paschoal et al. suggested that the combined therapy of low-dose rosiglitazone with GPR120 agonist compound A might improve safety by reducing side effects and increasing the metabolic benefit on glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity [20]. In drug discovery, natural products are abundant sources of chemical entities with structural diversity. Natural products have been used to treat diabetes for decades [21]. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify a GPR40 and GPR120 dual agonist from our in-house natural compound library with little to no activation of PPARγ. Herein, a ligand-based virtual screening approach followed by docking screening was used to select potential GPR40 and GPR120 dual agonists (Figure S1, Supporting Information). We identified crocetin as a dual agonist of GPR40 and GPR120. Crocetin, a 20-carbon dicarboxylic acid, is a natural carotenoid and commercially available constituent of Crocus sativus Linne (saffron) [22].  In recent years, studies have demonstrated that saffron (Crocus sativus L.) is a natural product with promising glycemic control effects. Saffron and its components have been demonstrated to have hypolipidemic, antidiabetic, and antihypertensive properties in in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials investigations [23]. The major saffron compounds are crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal. Among them, the carotenoid components in saffron, crocin and crocetin, have been extensively researched for their potential to decrease cholesterol and prevent diabetes. Crocins are a unique class of remarkably hydrophilic apocarotenoids, comprising the primary components of saffron. Within saffron, crocetin, the aglycone derived from crocins, naturally occurs and is biosynthetically produced through the enzymatic cleavage of crocins within biological systems [24]. Several studies have shown that crocetin possesses significant pharmacological effects in various diseases, including neuroprotective, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, antiviral, antinociceptive, antidepressant, anticancer, antidiabetic, and memory enhancing properties [22]. However, the antidiabetic activity of crocetin has not been studied as extensively as crocin. In vitro studies suggest that 10 μM of crocetin attenuates palmitate-induced insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes via phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) serine 307 [25,26]. In vivo studies reveal that 5 μM of crocetin (5 μM) treatment therapy reduced proliferative damage to diabetic endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and increased caspase-3 activity, LDH release, and cell death [27]. Crocetin decreased the expression levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, GSH-Px, GSH, and CAT, and increased body weight in rats with STZ-induced gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). It also suppressed the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), COX-2, and PGE2 [28]. Clinical trials involving patients who consumed saffron capsules have demonstrated significant alleviation of sleep problems, anxiety, and mild-to-moderate comorbid depression-anxiety (CDA). Additionally, other studies have reported that daily saffron consumption can enhance sleep quality in diabetic patients and exert a positive impact on their anxiety levels [22]. However, the effects of crocetin on glucose uptake and insulin and GLP-1 secretion, as well as the antidiabetic mechanism of crocetin, remain unclear. In this study, we have successfully identified saffron’s antidiabetic component at the molecular level, highlighting crocetin as a GPR40/120 agonist. This pioneering discovery positions crocetin as a promising therapeutic candidate for type 2 diabetes, marking the first unveiling of such potential. Furthermore, we characterized crocetin’s mechanism of action and assessed its antidiabetic properties in various cell types, including mouse pancreatic beta cells (MIN6), mouse intestinal neuroendocrine cells (STC-1), and embryonic mouse fibroblast (3T3-L1) adipocytes, shedding light on its potential role in diabetes management.

            "Materials and Methods": "2.1. Cell Culture and Differentiation: Mouse 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes (Zen-Bio, Inc., Durham, NC, USA) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; LM 001-07, Welgene Biotech Co., Ltd., Gyeongsan-si, Republic of Korea) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (BCS; Thermo Fisher Scientific Korea Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea) and 1% 100× antibiotic–antimycotic solution (Welgene Biotech Co., Ltd., Gyeongsan-si, Republic of Korea) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cell differentiation was initiated by adding DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Welgene Biotech Co., Ltd., Gyeongsan-si, Republic of Korea), 1% 100× antibiotic–antimycotic solution, 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX; Merk KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), 1 μM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MI, USA), and 5 μg/mL insulin (Merck KgaA, Darmstadt, Germany) when 3T3-L1 cells reached 100% confluence. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Then, the culture medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% 100× antibiotic–antimycotic solution, and 5 μg/mL insulin (differentiation medium II). After an additional 48 h of incubation, the cells were cultured in DMEM containing only 10% FBS and 1% 100× antibiotic–antimycotic solution, with medium changes every 48 h. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells (#CCL-61, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% 100× antibiotic–antimycotic solution at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The MIN6 cells (#C0018008, AddexBio Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea) were cultured in DMEM containing 15% heat-inactivated FBS (10082147, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 1% 100× antibiotic–antimycotic solution, and 55 μM β-mercaptoethanol (21985023, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The STC-1 cells (#CRL-3254, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% 100× antibiotic–antimycotic solution. All of the reagents are reported as their final concentrations in solution. 2.2. SRE and CRE Reporter Luciferase Assay: The CHO cells were plated in 96-well white plates (Corning® Costar®, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MI, USA) at a concentration of 1.5 × 104 cells per well in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% 100× antibiotic–antimycotic solution and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. The SRE (pGL4.33[luc2P/SRE/Hygro]) and CRE (pGL4.33[luc2P/CRE/Hygro]) plasmids were acquired from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) and cotransfected into CHO cells with GPR40 and GPR120 using the lipofetamineTM 3000 (L3000015, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) as the transfection reagent. Following a 3 h incubation, the transfected cells were treated with the compounds of interest, while control cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO in culture medium and incubated for an additional 24 h. Luciferase activity was quantified using the Bright-GloTM Assay System (Cat. #E2620; Promega, Madison, WI, USA). All individual in vitro assays for determining the average efficiencies were repeated more than three times with triplicate wells for each treatment. 2.3. PPARg Transactivation Activity: Briefly, CHO cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells per well in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% 100× antibiotic–antimycotic solution. After a 24 h incubation, the cells were cotransfected with pPPRE-TK-Luc (addgene, #1015) and pCMV6-hPPARG-GFP (RG201538, OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD, US) using Lipofetamine 3000 (Cat. # L3000015, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, US). Following a 3 h transfection, the cells were treated with the compounds of interest and incubated for an additional 24 h. Control cells were treated with 0.2% DMSO in culture medium. Luciferase activity was assessed using the Bright-GloTM Assay System (Cat. #E2620; Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Each individual in vitro assay for determining the average efficiencies was performed three times with triplicate wells for each treatment. 2.4. Insulin Secretion Assay: Briefly, MIN6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) and incubated overnight to achieve 90% confluence. 1M glucose stock was used to prepare fresh 3 mM glucose KRBB buffer or 17 mM glucose KRBB buffer. Then, the culture medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-balanced Krebs/Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRBB) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA, 9048-46-8, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA). Then, the cells were starved at 37 °C for 2 h in 3 mM glucose KRBB buffer. After starvation, the culture medium was changed via the indicated compounds at 37 °C for 2 h in KRBB buffer containing 3 mM or 17 mM glucose. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until insulin assay. Insulin levels were determined using a mouse high-range insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (80-INSMSH-E01, ALPCO, Windham, NH, USA). All individual in vitro assays for determining the average efficiencies were performed more than three times using triplicate wells for each treatment. 2.5. GLP-1 Secretion Assay: In brief, STC-1 cells were plated in 96-well poly-D-lysine coated plates (354640, Corning®, New York, NY, USA) at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells per well in the culture medium. The plate was subsequently incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2. Following incubation, cells were gently washed with 200 μL prewarmed Hank’s balanced salt buffer (HBSS, SH30268.02, Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) with 0.1% BSA to remove background secretions. Subsequently, the cells were subjected to a 3 h period of serum starvation in HBSS with 0.1% BSA. The treatment compounds were diluted in DMEM with 0.1% BSA supplemented with 5 μM the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, KR-62436 (761414-79-3, Sigma-Aldrich), and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The cell supernatant was collected following centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until analysis. The levels of secreted GLP-1 were quantified using the mouse/human/rat GLP-1/glucagon-like peptide 1 ELISA kit (LS-F412, LSBIO, Seattle, WA, USA). 2.6. Glucose Uptake Assay: Mature 3T3-L1 cells were initially subjected to a 16 h period of serum starvation in low-glucose DMEM (2323667, Gibco BRL, Thermo Fisher Scientific Korea Ltd.). Subsequently, they were either treated for an additional 2 h with crocetin or 30 min with 100 nM insulin in glucose-depleted DMEM (11966025Gibco BRL, Thermo Fisher Scientific Korea Ltd.). Following treatment, the cells were exposed to 100 μM 2-NBDG (Thermo Fisher Scientific Korea Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea) at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the cells were gently washed with precooled PBS, and the fluorescence intensity was quantified (Ex/Em = 485/535 nm) using a fluorescence microplate reader (VictorTM X4, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). 2.7. Western Blotting: The 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were seeded in six-well plates at a concentration of 1.5 × 105 cells/well in a final volume of 2 mL and differentiated as previously described. Then, the cells were incubated in low-glucose DMEM. After overnight incubation, the medium was changed to glucose-depleted DMEM. The cells were then treated with different concentrations of the compound in the absence or presence of 100 nM insulin and incubated for 1 h. The cells were harvested by RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MI, USA) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea), and proteins (20 μg) from each lysate were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Merk KgaA, Darmstadt, Germany), maintained at 200 mA for 120 min. The membranes were then blocked with 5% skim milk in 0.1% tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween® 20 Detergent (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then probed overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in 0.1% BSA. Secondary antibodies were used at a concentration of 1:5000 for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were marked using EzWestLumi plus detection reagents (ATTO Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and detected by a LuminoGraph II imaging system (ATTO Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The antibodies used were anti-p-Akt (cat.# 4060, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA), anti-t-Akt (cat.# 4691, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA), and anti-beta-actin antibodies (cat.# GTX109639, GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA). 2.8. Structure-Based In-House Library Search: From the in-house library composed with 1158 natural compounds, we conducted a similarity search on our hit compounds with the Canvas similarity and Clustering module in Schrodinger. Tanimoto similarity metric was used, and candidates were selected via similarity score and visual inspection. 2.9. Molecular Modeling: Ligand docking was carried out using Schrodinger Maestro 2020-4 in Windows 10 system (Schrodinger Release 2020-4: Schrodinger, LLC, New York, NY, USA, 2020). Liga 19nds were prepared by using the 2D sketch module and Ligprep module. To facilitate docking, all possible ionization states of the ligands, including the neutral state, were generated under physiological pH conditions. The X-ray and Cryo-EM structures of human GPR40 (PDB ID: 5TZR and 5TZY) and GPR120 (PDB ID: 8ID4 and 8ID8) were obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/ (accessed on 19 May 2023)) [29] and were prepared using the protein preparation module. Prime was employed to replace any missing side chains, while extraneous water molecules were eliminated. For XP-docking, the ligand docking module employed XP-glide with default settings, and no constraints were applied. The co-crystallized ligand was used to define the centers of the grid boxes, with all grid boxes set to 25 A. A total of 20 poses were generated for each ligand and exported for manual comparison. 2.10. Chemicals: The 1158 natural compounds were obtained from Biopurify Phytochemicals Ltd., Chengdu, China, without further purification. 2.11. Statistical Analysis: GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used to analyze the data and find significant differences. Single comparisons between the two experimental groups were performed using an unpaired Student’s t-test. Multiple comparisons were performed using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s test. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).",
            "Results": "3.1. Identification of Crocetin as GPR40/120 Dual Agonist: The screening strategy and diverse criteria were combined to choose hit compounds, as shown in Supporting information, Figure S1. Firstly, to save time and cost, 48 compounds representing different skeletons were selected from our in-house natural product library (Table S1) and their activity were evaluated by reporter assay. The reference compounds were AMG1637, a full GPR40 agonist, and GSK13764, a GPR120 agonist. Among the selected 43 natural compounds (Supporting information, Table S1), auraptene (a monoterpene coumarin compound) and ricinoleic acid (an unsaturated omega-9 fatty acid) exhibited the strongest activation of GPR40 and GPR120.  3.1. Identification of Crocetin as GPR40/120 Dual Agonist: To find more potential agonists, we next performed a similarity-search screening using auraptene and ricinoleic acid as templates from a commercial natural compound library comprised of 1158 compounds. A combined total of 46 compounds with a similarity score greater than 0.11 were screened for docking (Table S2). The final binding poses were ranked according to their expected binding affinity generated by the scoring function implemented in the Schrodinger program. The top 20 compounds were selected after visual inspection and their activities were assessed using the reporter assay. Several compounds demonstrated modest activities against GPR40 and GPR120. Among them, crocetin was identified as the most active compound since it exhibited greater than 90% activation of GPR40 and GPR120 at a concentration of 20 μM (Supporting information, Table S2). Thus, we selected crocetin as our lead compound for further mechanism evaluation. To our surprise, even crocetin exhibited 101.56% and 114.63% of Emax toward GPR40 and GPR120, respectively. In contrast, the Emax of crocin was only 6.00% and 5.35% for GPR40 and GPR120, respectively (Supporting information, Table S1). As a result, although crocin, a glycoside of crocetin, is the main component of saffron’s antidiabetic effect, we discovered that crocetin might also be a promising agent as a GPR40 and GPR120 dual agonist. This compound has a polyunsaturated conjugated acid structure containing four methyl groups on the side chains and seven conjugated double bonds, which include a trans-form and cis-form. In general, the trans-form is more stable than the cis-form [30]; therefore, this study mainly discusses the bioactivity of the trans-form. 3.1. Identification of Crocetin as GPR40/120 Dual Agonist: Based on recent studies, it is believed that GPR40 and GPR120 coupled with either Gq or Gs proteins depending on the different types of agonists. It was found that the secretion of incretin is mainly dependent on the activation of the Gq protein, while further activating the Gs protein produces an additional incretin response [31]. Therefore, we determined the signaling pathway mediating the effects of crocetin. As shown in Figure 1A,B, crocetin demonstrated 9.18- and 42.45-fold higher values than dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in the serum response element (SRE)-Luciferase (Luc) (Gq) reporter assay, with EC50 values of 2.91 and 2.11 μM (Figure 1C), respectively. In contrast, crocetin only showed 2.60- and 1.57-fold higher values than DMSO in the cAMP response element (CRE)-Luc (Gs) assay. These data revealed that crocetin can strongly activate the Gq pathway and moderately activate the Gs pathway, demonstrating a dual mode of action which induced the release of insulin. 3.1. Identification of Crocetin as GPR40/120 Dual Agonist: Fatty acids can also activate PPARγ, an antidiabetic target, with limited clinical utility due to undesirable side effects. Therefore, in order to verify the selectivity for GPR40 and GPR120, we ascertained the PPARγ transactivation activities of crocetin. As shown in Figure 1D, even at the concentration of 20 μM, crocetin still demonstrated weak selectivity for PPARγ, lowering the possibility of unforeseen side effects significantly. 3.2. Crocetin Is an Orthosteric Full Agonist of GPR40 and GPR120: The binding site of crocetin was investigated. The orthosteric site is the binding pocket for endogenous ligands of GPCRs, while the binding of other chemicals with receptors in a noncovalent manner (e.g., activating the receptor or blocking the effects of an endogenous agonist) does not inherently have to occur in the same region. Efficacy and affinity are the two key properties that determine how the ligands act on GPCRs [32].  3.2. Crocetin Is an Orthosteric Full Agonist of GPR40 and GPR120: Free fatty acids (FFA) are present in circulation and bind to both GPR40 and GPR120 endogenously; thus, the binding site of FFAs is identified as the orthosteric binding pocket. To explore the synergistic effect of crocetin and FFAs, we performed the SRE reporter assay. Linoleic acid (LA), a potent and effective long-chain FA, was used to investigate the binding activation site of crocetin on GPR40 or GPR120. As shown in Figure 2B,C, even though crocetin showed significant agonism toward both GPR40 and GPR120, when we fixed the concentration of crocetin with values equal to LA and coapplied it with LA, no shift was observed in the maximal response and potency. The functional assay response curve fits well in the pharmacological characterization curve of orthosteric ligands [32]. This result suggests that crocetin might be a full agonist and binds to the orthosteric binding pocket of GPR40 and GPR120.  3.2. Crocetin Is an Orthosteric Full Agonist of GPR40 and GPR120: Furthermore, based on the crystal structure of GPR40 (PDB ID: 5TZY), the full agonist binding site could also serve as an FFA binding site and exhibit positive cooperation between partial agonists such as TAK875 [33]. Thus, we further investigated the cooperative effect between crocetin and TAK875. As shown in Figure 2D, crocetin demonstrated a significant shift toward the left on the concentration−response curve, indicating that the binding of crocetin might improve the activity of GPR40 partial agonists.  3.2. Crocetin Is an Orthosteric Full Agonist of GPR40 and GPR120: Collectively, these data suggest that crocetin is a full orthosteric agonist of GPR40 and GPR120 and a positive modulator of TAK875 on GPR40. 3.3. Crocetin Stimulates Insulin and GLP-1 Secretion: To assess crocetin-induced insulin secretion, we conducted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) assays. The common in vitro study of GSIS suggested that pancreatic beta cells could be best characterized by a dynamic stimulation index obtained using a glucose step between 3–5 and 14–17 mM [31]. Seeing that the activation of GPR40/120 stimulates insulin secretion in a glucose concentration-dependent manner, insulin secretion in MIN6 cells was measured at 3 mM and 17 mM glucose. Linoleic acid was employed as a positive control to prove the functionality of the GSIS assay system. As illustrated in Figure 3A, when MIN6 cells are exposed to 3 mM glucose, high crocetin concentrations (10 μM and 20 μM) cause the cells to release very little insulin. However, as shown in Figure 3B, crocetin significantly enhanced GSIS in the presence of 17 mM glucose compared to that induced by 10 μM of LA, showing a 0.71 μM EC50 for insulin secretion (Figure 3C).  3.3. Crocetin Stimulates Insulin and GLP-1 Secretion: Intestinal L-cells emit GLP-1, an incretin hormone, which stimulates insulin secretion and exhibits a potent effect on β-cell growth and differentiation [34]. Therefore, GLP-1-based therapies also have the benefit of improving glycemic control with little risk of hypoglycemia, avoiding weight gain, reducing blood pressure, and improving β-cell function [35]. Thus, we further investigated the effect of crocetin on GLP-1 secretion in STC-1 cells. We observed that GLP-1 secretion was concentration-dependent, demonstrating a significant (p ≤ 0.001) increase with crocetin concentration (Figure 3D). Although the effect of crocetin in stimulating GLP-1 secretion at high concentrations (30 μM) was similar to that of linoleic acid, at low concentrations (10 μM), crocetin still strongly stimulated GLP-1 release, exhibiting potency. Consequently, crocetin appears to have a dual mechanism of action in glucose-lowering activity. 3.4. Crocetin Increases Glucose Uptake in Mature 3T3-L1 Adipocytes and Insulin-Independent Akt Pathway and Increases Insulin Sensitivity: As previously mentioned, GPR120 is highly expressed in mature adipocytes and increases glucose uptake. Thus, to clarify the antidiabetic effect of crocetin, a 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG) uptake assay was carried out using differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The 2-NBDG served as a fluorescent glucose probe. Following 3 h of starvation, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with the indicated concentration of crocetin for 2 h, with additional incubation in the presence or absence of 100 nM insulin for 30 min. The 2-NBDG was finally added to the cells for 30 min and rinsed with cold PBS before the fluorescence intensity (Ex/Em = 485/535 nm) was measured. As shown in Figure 4A, crocetin significantly increased both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. Compared with controls, with 5 μM, 10 μM, and 20 μM crocetin, glucose uptake significantly improved by 1.43-, 1.68-, and 1.85-fold, respectively, in the absence of insulin treatment. Moreover, crocetin at concentrations of 10 μM and 20 μM significantly improved insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-NBDG by approximately 1.12- (p < 0.05) and 1.31- (p < 0.001) fold, respectively, compared with the insulin-only group. 3.4. Crocetin Increases Glucose Uptake in Mature 3T3-L1 Adipocytes and Insulin-Independent Akt Pathway and Increases Insulin Sensitivity: To further elucidate the mechanism of action of crocetin, we assessed the phosphorylation of Akt in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes via Western blotting. As shown in Figure 4B and 4C, in the absence of insulin, crocetin augmented the expression level of phospho-Akt by approximately 6.0-fold, suggesting crocetin upregulated glucose uptake through the phosphorylation of the Akt pathway in an insulin-independent manner. While in the presence of 100 nM insulin, crocetin showed a synergistic Akt phosphorylation-improving effect, suggesting that crocetin might be an insulin-sensitizing agent to treat type 2 diabetes. These results indicate that crocetin treatment improves glucose uptake via activation of the Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, crocetin exhibited no lipid accumulation effect in 3T3-L1 cells, posing little risk of fat accumulation and other side effects (Supporting information Figure S1). 3.5. Molecular Docking Analysis of Crocetin: In order to investigate the molecular underpinnings of the interactions between GPR40/120 and crocetin, computational docking studies were conducted. Orthogonal binding pockets or binding sites of full agonists are mainly discussed. For GPR40, crystal structures of GPR40-MK-8666-monoolein (PDB ID: 5TZR) and GPR40-MK-8666-AP8 (PDB ID: 5TZY) complexes were prepared for the docking of crocetin [33]. In comparison, PDB 5TZY showed an adequate binding pose and docking score because the conformation of the loop between TM3 and TM4 was secured (XP-GScore: −8.126), while it was missing in PDB 5TZR, which had a structurally similar ligand, monoolein, in the binding pocket (XP-GScore: −5.735). One carboxylate group of crocetin forms a hydrogen bond (H-bond) with Tyr114 where the carboxylate group of co-crystallized monoolein and AP8 are aligned. The other carboxylate group forms an additional H-bond with the carbonyl backbone of Leu189. A long aliphatic carbon chain interacts with the hydrophobic binding pocket of GPR40 composed of multiple lipophilic residues (Figure 5A). 3.5. Molecular Docking Analysis of Crocetin: Recently, the Cryo-EM structures of the GPR120–linoleic acid complex and multiple ligands have been revealed [29]. Before this structural biology study, the key residue which was considered essential for the carboxylate type of GPR120 agonists was Arg99 [36], forming multiple H-bonds at the entrance of the orthogonal pocket and the carboxylate group. However, the revealed orthogonal pocket with natural FFAs were separate from the Arg99, and the “L” configuration of the hydrophobic binding pocket recognized the double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids (Figure 5B). Crocetin tightly bonded to the orthogonal site of GPR120 and could mimic the interactions of natural ligands with multiple double bonds but could not show the “L-configuration” due to its structural rigidity (XP-GScore: −6.295). Terminal carboxylates formed aromatic H-bonds with Phe88 and potential H-bonds with Glu204 and the backbone of Phe25. The docking simulation results demonstrate that crocetin mimics natural ligands’ binding features through H-bonds, π-π, and hydrophobic interactions. While crocin, glycoside of crocetin, could not, fit into the binding pocket due to steric hindrance. Collectively, this study reveals the binding site of crocetin which is the real active component of saffron in GPR40/120, and its potential role in the antidiabetic effect.",
            "Discussion": "In recent years, in vitro and in vivo studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that saffron is a natural product with promising glycemic control effects. Multiple studies have confirmed saffron’s beneficial effects on diabetic animals’ metabolic conditions such as hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. However, in vitro studies on the antidiabetic potential of saffron are mainly focused on its chief ingredients, crocin. In this study, we have, for the first time, identified the molecular-level target responsible for the authentic active component in saffron which imparts its antidiabetic effect. Our findings clearly establish that crocetin, as opposed to crocin, acts as an agonist for GPR40 and GPR120, positioning it as a potential therapy option for type 2 diabetes. GPR40 and GPR120 are highly expressed in pancreatic cells and enteroendocrine cells, participate in the potentiation of insulin by free fatty acids, and, most importantly, prevent hypoglycemic complications. Several synthetic compounds and traditional natural compounds have been reported as GPR40 or GPR120 agonists in the literature. However, no GPR40/120 ligands have been approved as antidiabetic drugs. Unfortunately, trials with the GPR40 agonist TAK875 were stopped in phase III, owing to the liver toxicity associated with its chemical structure. In contrast, crocetin is a plant-derived compound from saffron, which is treated as a natural healthcare product, owing to its safety. Thus, crocetin may find application in the treatment of T2DM as a dual agonist of GPR40 and GPR120. After conducting the ligand-based similarity search, docking, and cell-based reporter assay screening, crocetin was selected as the most active compound which exhibited an agonistic effect against GPR40 and GPR120 with an EC50 value of 2.91 ± 0.32 μM and 2.01 ± 0.17 μM, respectively. In the kinetic study, crocetin was identified as an orthosteric full agonist, which moderately activated both Gq and Gs pathways and revealed positive cooperation with the partial agonist TAK875 on GPR40. It was observed that both MIN6 and STC-1 cells displayed excellent insulin and GLP-1 secretion upon treatment with crocetin. This suggests that the dual agonist exhibited a powerful and dual mechanism of action for stimulating insulin secretion. Furthermore, as GLP-1 levels were also elevated in crocetin-treated enteroendocrine cells, this dual impact may arise during in vivo investigations when crocetin may directly affect insulin secretion or boost incretin secretion. However, in comparison to adipocyte models, myocyte models have been used more extensively in vitro to study metabolic disease progression. In our case, we are working on the adipocyte models to explore the glucose uptake effect of crocetin, since GPR120 is likewise barely expressed in muscle but abundantly expressed in mature adipocytes [9]. In mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, activation of the Akt pathway is one of the main mechanisms of glucose absorption via the activation of the signaling cascade involving PI3-kinase through the activation of GPCRs. However, unlike other insulin-dependent pathways via the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family or tyrosine phosphatases, the PI3-kinase activation through GPCRs is dependent on Gq protein recruitment in an insulin-independent manner. Thus, in the absence of insulin, crocetin still exhibited a significant effect on Akt phosphorylation, while in the presence of insulin, crocetin showed synergistic Akt phosphorylation-improving effects, suggesting that crocetin could increase insulin sensitivity and shows potential as an insulin-sensitizing agent to treat type 2 diabetes. Nonetheless, while our research has substantiated the GPCR-dependent nature of glucose uptake, the conclusive characterization of the specific involvement of GPR40 and GPR120 in the antidiabetic function necessitates the utilization of GPR40 and GPR120 antagonists or gene silencing techniques to furnish direct evidence. Since the primary mechanism for glucose uptake into fat cells is glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)’s translocation to the cell surface, analysis of the GLUT4 translocation was not conducted in this study. Additional studies are required to measure the basal- and crocetin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in adipocytes. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to anticipate that the influence of crocetin may become more evident in subsequent in vivo analysis. This expectation is based on the established role of insulin in regulating glucose metabolism as it facilitates the translocation of intracellular GLUT4 to the cell surface. Moreover, crocetin’s capacity to stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic cells can further enhance glucose uptake in adipocytes, potentially showcasing its effects more prominently in in vivo studies. In conclusion, our research has unveiled a novel insight into the molecular basis of saffron’s antidiabetic effect. At the molecular level, we have pinpointed the key component and its target receptors. Notably, we have established that crocetin, distinct from crocin, acts as a dual orthosteric full agonist of GPR40 and GPR120, effectively promoting insulin and GLP-1 secretion while enhancing cellular glucose homeostasis. This discovery positions crocetin as a potent and groundbreaking candidate for diabetic therapy. To advance its development for clinical applications, further investigations involving in vivo studies to assess plasma glucose and insulin levels are imperative."

        "abstract": "Crocin, a glycoside of crocetin, has been known as the principal component responsible for saffron's antidiabetic, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory effects. Crocetin, originating from the hydrolytic cleavage of crocin in biological systems, was subjected to ligand-based virtual screening in this investigation. Subsequent biochemical analysis unveiled crocetin, not crocin, as a novel dual GPR40 and GPR120 agonist, demonstrating a marked preference for GPR40 and GPR120 over peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)γ. This compound notably enhanced insulin and GLP-1 secretion from pancreatic β-cells and intestinal neuroendocrine cells, respectively, presenting a dual mechanism of action in glucose-lowering effects. Docking simulations showed that crocetin emulates the binding characteristics of natural ligands through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, whereas crocin's hindered fit within the binding pocket is attributed to steric constraints. Collectively, for the first time, this study unveils crocetin as the true active component of saffron, functioning as a GPR40/120 agonist with potential implications in antidiabetic interventions.",

            "Introduction": "The salivary peptide Histatin 5 (Hst 5) is constitutively expressed in human saliva, has potent candidacidal activity for the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans, and metal ion-binding ability including copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) ions [1,2,3]. These characteristics are supported by decades of research, yet the role of Hst 5 at the host-pathogen interface has remained understudied and poorly understood. As an antifungal peptide, Hst 5 has long been postulated to function in the innate immune response to maintain a commensal microbiome. For example, Hst 5 is induced over 3-fold with early childhood caries [4], suggesting a role in responding to changes in the oral microenvironment. Furthermore, it has been suggested that Hst 5 is involved in host nutritional immunity [5] in the sequestration of metal ions away from invading pathogens due to its affinity for Zn (Kd = 1.2 × 10−5 M−1) [2]. However, the affinity of Hst 5 for Zn is orders of magnitude lower than other salivary Zn-binding proteins such as calprotectin (Kd = 1.4 × 10−9 M−1) [6], or the C. albicans zincophore Pra1 (Kd = 1.3 × 10−9 M−1) [7]. It is therefore unlikely that Hst 5 substantially contributes to fungicidal Zn sequestration at salivary pH. Despite this, Zn binding by Hst 5 has been shown by our group and others to be an interaction which could affect the in-situ function of Hst 5 by inducing intra-peptide compaction and dimerization of the peptide [8,9,10]. We also found that the addition of Zn at a ratio of 1 Zn to 2 Hst 5 potentiated the candidacidal activity of Hst 5, confirming that Zn induces a functional change in the peptide [10]. These zinc-binding characteristics bear similarity to zinc-regulatory proteins responsible for sensing and responding to intracellular zinc flux in human cells [11]. Since Hst 5 concentrations in saliva are approximately a 2:1 ratio with salivary zinc [12,13], it is clear that natural zinc flux from the external environment can have a profound effect on the mode of activity of Hst 5. Hst 5 functions through an intracellular mechanism via uptake through the polyamine transporters Dur3 and Dur31 to induce ROS, cell cycle arrest, and non-lytic potassium and ATP efflux [14,15,16,17]. In contrast to this, we found that Zn increased the killing activity of Hst 5 through a pathway that results in rapid ATP efflux and does not require active uptake into fungal cells, consistent with fungicidal or fungistatic cell surface damage [18]. Zn increases the ability of Hst 5 to closely interact with membranes [19] while additionally promoting oligomerization [10], suggesting pore formation as a possible mechanism. Since physiological levels of Hst 5 in saliva do not kill all oral yeast, it is likely that these survivor C. albicans cells have undergone changes in their cell wall as a compensatory tactic following exposure with Hst 5. Therefore, we hypothesized that Hst 5+Zn would induce a different profile of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) stress response than Hst 5, with an increase in the relative importance of cell-wall repair signaling. Though there are three stress-signaling MAPKs in C. albicans (HOG1, CEK1, MKC1), the response to cell-surface stress is primarily controlled by the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway [20,21,22,23]. The CWI MAPK, Mkc1, is responsible for protective responses to a variety of cell-wall damaging agents, such as caspofungin, congo red, reactive oxygen species, and azoles [24]. The activation of Mkc1 is apparently dispensable for the immediate stress response to the membrane disrupting drug Amphotericin B (Amp B) [25], and yet high Mkc1 activation is seen in Amp B resistant cells [26] with the cell wall integrity pathway implicated in the fitness of Amp B-resistant mutants [27]. A major outcome of CWI signaling is cell wall chitin production through chitin synthase Chs3, which is under post-transcriptional control [25]. Furthermore, MAPK stress signaling induces changes in the geometry of cell-wall components β-1,3 glucan and mannan that can lead to altered host cell recognition of C. albicans cells [22,28,29]. Fungal β-1,3 glucan is generally considered to be the most important pro-inflammatory cell-wall component, and reduction in fungal glucan exposure can reduce host recognition [30]. Mannans are also recognized by host cells [28] and may also provide a barrier to limit access of fungicidal molecules to the plasma membrane [31]. The full role of chitin in recognition of C. albicans at the host epithelia is unclear and the subject of ongoing research [32], but it has been shown that purified C. albicans chitin upregulates production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in macrophages [33]. The rearrangement of the cell wall due to stress and other stimuli (i.e., treatment with a cell-surface damaging antifungal drug) can result in changes in the distribution of all 3 components at the cell surface and can cause unmasking of β-1,3 glucan [34]. Thus, changes in the abundance and expression of any cell wall component may impact other cell wall structures and alter host recognition. Receptors and pathways involved in the recognition of cell-wall components vary by cell type. Surfaces such as the oral epithelia can be in continuous contact with commensal Candida and therefore have a different role in the recognition and response to fungal cell-wall components than immune cells [31]. Oral epithelial cells (OECs) are the first cell type in the oral environment that encounter C. albicans and are able to discern between the relatively benign yeast form and the more virulent hyphal form [35]. Consequently, receptors such as TLR2, TLR4, and Dectin-1 that are typically considered major Candida cell-wall component receptors in immune cells [22,36] do not elicit an inflammatory response in OECs but can be involved in general cell sensing and signal modulation [37]. In OECs, the receptor EphA2 is responsible for recognizing β-1,3 glucans in conjunction with heteromeric binding partner EGFR [38,39]. EGFR and EphA2 are mutually required for activation in response to C. albicans and lead to MAPK signaling that results in upregulation of cytokines, chemokines, and AMPs via the transcription factor c-Fos [35,39,40]. Though dectin-1 appears to play a reduced role in cell-wall sensing in OECs, signaling through NF-κB via dectin-1 does appear to contribute to the magnitude of cytokine release in response to β-glucans [38]. In any case, the overall signaling response of OECs to the fungal cell wall is highly variable due to the individual influence of the various polysaccharides. Since Hst 5 is constitutively expressed in the oral environment, we theorized that Hst 5+Zn plays a role in maintaining a commensal relationship between C. albicans and host epithelial cells. To demonstrate the basis for such an interaction, we utilized an experimental model whereby C. albicans cells were pre-incubated with Hst 5 or Hst 5+Zn before seeding onto epithelial cell monolayers. A low-metal-binding, low-activity derivative of Hst 5, with ATCUN and HExxH motifs mutated to glutamine, herein named Hst 5ΔMB, was used as a comparison to understand the role of Zn binding on the downstream effects to the C. albicans cell wall. We found that Hst 5+Zn treated cells indeed had increased Mkc1 signaling and elevated cell surface expression of β-1,3 glucan, chitin and mannans compared to Hst 5 alone. Hst 5+Zn treated cells also elicited a distinct signaling response in oral epithelial cells that culminated in anti-inflammatory changes in cytokine release. Furthermore, these Hst 5+Zn treated cells had elevated host adhesion but were ultimately less invasive than cells treated with Hst 5 alone.",
            "Results": "2.1. Hst 5+Zn-Treated C. albicans Cells Have Increased Mkc1 Signaling: To determine the stress response of C. albicans cells that survive treatment with Hst 5 or Hst 5+Zn, we first assayed the survival of C. albicans after treatment with 3.15 fmol/cell Hst 5 or Hst 5ΔMB (± Zn) in dilute media buffer (DMB) (Figure 1A). At this dosage, we found that 92% of cells treated with Hst 5 survived compared to DMB-only control cells. As expected, the survival rate was lower in cells treated with Hst 5+Zn, but 61% still survived compared to control cells. Hst 5ΔMB and Hst 5ΔMB+Zn have almost no toxicity on C. albicans cells and had 99–100% survival under these conditions. We expected that Hst 5+Zn survivor cells would have a strong stress response that was distinct from cells surviving treatment with Hst 5 alone due to different mechanisms of action. We investigated the response of 3 major MAPK signaling pathways (Mkc1, Cek1 and Hog1) in cells treated with Hst 5 or Hst 5ΔMB with or without added Zn (Figure 1B). Hst 5-treated cells showed the strongest phosphorylation of Mkc1 at 5 min that subsequently decreased after 15–30 min, while yeast treated with Hst 5+Zn resulted in very strong and sustained P-Mkc1 from 5–30 min. Some increase in Cek1 phosphorylation occurred at 30 min in all conditions. No clear difference was observed between DMB+Zn control, Hst 5 or Hst 5+Zn with respect to Hog1 phosphorylation, although all conditions induced P-Hog1 compared to media alone (not shown). To determine whether P-Mkc1 was related to stress induced by antifungal effects of Hst 5, we examined cells treated with the low activity peptide Hst 5ΔMB or Hst 5ΔMB+Zn. Indeed, cells treated with this mutated peptide with or without added zinc did not elicit P-Mkc1 signaling. 2.1. Hst 5+Zn-Treated C. albicans Cells Have Increased Mkc1 Signaling: As the MAPK of the cell wall integrity pathway, Mkc1 signaling is closely linked to protection from cell wall stress, including through upregulation of chitin production [23]. Therefore, we expected that knock-out of MKC1 would result in C. albicans cells that are more susceptible to killing by Hst 5+Zn. We tested the candidacidal activity of Hst 5 and Hst 5+Zn in an Mkc1 homozygous deletion mutant (mkc1Δ/Δ) and a chitin synthesis mutant (chs4Δ/Δ) that is required for activation of an Mkc1-regulated chitin synthase (Figure 1C). A C. albcans\nchs4 null mutant has been previously shown to have decreased chitin deposition compared to wild type cells [41]. When treating mkc1Δ/Δ cells with Hst 5 alone we found that there was not a significant change in killing compared with strain SN250. However, the combination of Hst 5+Zn significantly potentiated killing activity to 60%, suggesting that Mkc1 signaling is protective against Hst 5+Zn but dispensable for the response to Hst 5. Likewise, chs4Δ/Δ cells that lack Mkc1-dependent chitin synthase activity were not sensitive to Hst 5 at this dosage but were significantly more susceptible to killing by Hst 5+Zn, indicating that protection against killing afforded by Mkc1 signaling is mediated by chitin synthesis. 2.2. Hst 5+Zn-Treated Cells Have Higher Cell Wall Chitin, β-1,3 glucan, and Mannan: As Mkc1 signaling results in cell-wall remodeling in response to stress, we anticipated that C. albicans cells that survived challenge with Hst 5 or Hst 5+Zn would exhibit changes in their cell wall structure. We assessed fluorescently labeled cell wall components using flow cytometry, specifically measuring chitin (Figure 2A), β-1,3 glucans (Figure 2B), and mannans (Figure 2C) following 3 h incubation with Hst 5, Hst 5+Zn and the low-activity mutant peptide Hst 5ΔMB. We additionally analyzed the cells treated with Caspofungin (CasF) as a positive control for induction of chitin synthesis and Amphotericin B (Amp B) to compare cell-wall changes under membrane-disrupting conditions. 2.2. Hst 5+Zn-Treated Cells Have Higher Cell Wall Chitin, β-1,3 glucan, and Mannan: Chitin staining was significantly (p = 0.0021) higher in Hst 5+Zn treated cells (1.6 fold to baseline) compared to Hst 5 (1.3-fold) although both treatments increased levels of chitin exposure (Figure 2A). However, chitin exposure was not altered following incubation with the zinc-binding mutant Hst 5ΔMB either with or without Zn. Chitin remodeling due to Hst 5 was similar to that resulting from Amp B treatment (1.4-fold, p = 0.0017) rather than cells treated with CasF (1.1-fold, p = 0.009), suggesting a high level of chitin exposure is induced in response to membrane disrupting drugs. The staining of β-1,3 glucan was unchanged in C. albicans cells treated with Hst 5 alone but was significantly (p = 0.0094) higher (1.5 fold to baseline) in Hst 5+Zn treated cells (Figure 2B). Cells treated with Hst 5ΔMB+Zn also had a small but significant (p = 0.0126) increase in staining (1.3-fold) compared with Hst 5ΔMB treated cells. Again, Hst 5+Zn treated cells showed most similarity to cells treated with Amp B (a 1.7-fold increase in β-1,3 glucan staining) compared to CasF-treated cells that had a 6× increase in β-1,3 glucan exposure. The overall profile of mannan exposure (Figure 2C) was similar to chitin staining in that Hst 5+Zn significantly (p = 0.0147) increased (1.5-fold) mannan exposure compared to Hst 5 (1.2-fold increase); while cells treated with Hst 5ΔMB+Zn had a small (1.1-fold) but significant (p = 0.0134) increase in stained mannan. Cells treated with Amp B had significantly (p = 0.0182) higher mannan than control (1.4-fold) but cells treated with CasF had no significant change in mannan staining. Overall, we found that Hst 5+Zn had a similar profile of cell wall changes as for Amp B, showing increased exposure in all 3 components measured. Hst 5+Zn treatment also resulted in significantly elevated exposure of these cell wall components compared to cells treated with Hst 5 alone. 2.2. Hst 5+Zn-Treated Cells Have Higher Cell Wall Chitin, β-1,3 glucan, and Mannan: Confocal fluorescence microscopy on C. albicans survivor cells treated with Hst 5 or Hst 5+Zn was carried out to visualize changes in surface localization compared to control cells (Figure 2D). The localization of chitin appeared to be similarly distributed between control cells and cells treated with Hst 5, with bright staining over the entire cell especially at the bud neck and scar regions. In cells treated with Hst 5+Zn, we observed a shift in chitin staining density that favored the bud neck and scars. In agreement with quantitation of β-1,3 glucan staining (Figure 2B), cells treated with Hst 5 appeared to have reduced overall levels of β-1,3 glucan although small areas of intense staining were visible (white arrows). Hst 5+Zn treatment resulted in many cells that had nearly uniform contiguous surface β-1,3 glucan exposure, as well as areas of intense patches such as those found in Hst 5 treated cells. We could not discern any qualitative differences in localization of mannan staining in control cells compared to those treated with Hst 5 or Hst 5+Zn. Thus, although cells treated with Hst 5+Zn quantitatively increased the exposure of all 3 cell-wall components to a similar degree, we observed the greatest change in surface morphology of β-1,3 glucan exposure compared to chitin or mannans. 2.3. Oral Epithelial Cells Incubated with Hst 5+Zn-Treated C. albicans Have Increased Cell Wall Signaling Response but Reduced Inflammatory Cytokine Release: Since cell-wall reorganization can indicate changes in C. albicans virulence, we expected that the Hst 5+Zn survivor cell wall would induce signaling in oral epithelial cells and subsequent cytokine release. Monolayers of TR146 oral epithelial cells were seeded with methanol-fixed survivor cells for 1 h, then protein was collected and used for immunoblotting (Figure 3A). Protein was collected from C. albicans-naive monolayers as a negative control. Phosphorylation of β-1,3 glucan receptor EphA2 and binding partner EGFR was assayed to indicate a response to β-1,3 glucan. Activation of NF-κB was also tested since this pathway is likely independent of EphA2 and is frequently implicated in signaling in response to the fungal cell wall. As expected, we found that Hst 5+Zn-treated C. albicans induced phosphorylation of EphA2 in epithelial cells compared to the other treatment conditions. However, EGFR phosphorylation in TR146 cells did not appear to be induced by Hst 5+Zn survivor cells. This suggests that Hst 5+Zn treated C. albicans mainly interacts with EphA2 but does not induce activation of EGFR. Phosphorylation of NF-κB also appeared to be elevated in oral epithelial cells (OECs) exposed to Hst 5+Zn-treated C. albicans, indicating that at least one other epithelial cell receptor interacts with the Hst 5+Zn-modified cell wall. 2.3. Oral Epithelial Cells Incubated with Hst 5+Zn-Treated C. albicans Have Increased Cell Wall Signaling Response but Reduced Inflammatory Cytokine Release: The activation of EphA2 is associated with the upregulation of IL-1β and IL-8 in OECs, therefore we measured their release from TR146 monolayers after 24 h incubation with pre-treated, fixed C. albicans (Figure 3B). For epithelial cells incubated with C. albicans control cells (gray bars), we found that IL-1β was released into the supernatant at a concentration of 37.8 pg/mL, while monolayers incubated with Hst 5 survivor cells released only 20.5 pg/mL. Epithelial cells incubated with Hst 5+Zn survivor cells released significantly (p = 0.0318) less IL-1β than the control at only 11.7 pg/mL. The cytokine IL-8 was tested in the same manner and was released into supernatant at 294.5 pg/mL by epithelial cells that were incubated with control C. albicans. Epithelial cells that were incubated with Hst 5-treated cells released significantly (p = 0.016) less IL-8 at 147.2 pg/mL, and monolayers incubated with Hst 5+Zn survivor cells released only 76.9 pg/mL, which was significantly (p = 0.0025) less than the control cells. 2.3. Oral Epithelial Cells Incubated with Hst 5+Zn-Treated C. albicans Have Increased Cell Wall Signaling Response but Reduced Inflammatory Cytokine Release: The significant decrease in IL-8 and IL-1β release was unexpected but suggested a net anti-inflammatory signaling response by OECs to Hst 5+Zn-treated C. albicans. We then utilized a cytokine array to probe a wider range of cytokines involved in inflammation and innate immunity, with a particular focus on positive and negative inflammatory regulation and innate immune cell recruitment (Figure 3C). Cytokines were selected as biologically relevant if levels changed ± 0.5-fold in Ca+Hst 5+Zn-incubated OECs compared to control. Interestingly, all inflammatory cytokines that exhibited a more than ± 0.5-fold change did so in a negative direction, excepting the potent negative regulator IL-10, which was increased 2.5-fold. Other than IL-10, the greatest changes in cytokine release in OECs incubated with Ca+Hst 5+Zn were seen in MIP-1-δ, IL-5, and TGF-β1, which decreased to undetectable levels compared to control OECs. As a counterpoint, epithelial cells incubated with Hst 5-treated C. albicans had similar or elevated cytokine release compared to OECs incubated with control C. albicans so that only 10 of the 27 selected cytokines exhibited a fold change greater than 0.5-fold and all were elevated compared to control. Elevated cytokines included MIP-1-δ, TGF-β1, Leptin, Eotaxin, Eotaxin-2, Eotaxin-3, MDC, IL-10, IFN-γ, and IL-15. These results suggest that epithelial cells differentiate between the cell surface of Hst 5- and Hst 5+Zn-treated C. albicans with distinct signaling that terminates in a unique profile of cytokine release. In the case of Hst 5+Zn-treated C. albicans, this signaling appears to be anti-inflammatory. 2.4. Hst 5+Zn-Treated Cells Are More Adherent but Less Invasive to Oral Epithelial Cell Monolayers: Since IL-10 has a major role in the host tolerance of commensals and pathogens, we questioned whether the upregulation of this cytokine indicated a push towards commensal interactions between yeast and host. In order to determine if this decrease in inflammatory signaling was indeed mutually beneficial, we tested C. albicans virulence markers including the ability of cells to form hyphae, adherence, and invasion of an epithelial monolayer (Figure 4). Since C. albicans hyphal production is essential for adhesion and invasion, we first assessed whether Hst 5-treated survivor cells have any impairment in hyphae formation (Figure 4A). Hst 5-treated C. albicans cells were seeded onto epithelial monolayers for 30 min, and hyphal growth was measured. We found no decrease in hyphal length between Ca-only control cells, or Hst 5 and Hst 5+Zn-treated cells (Figure 4A), suggesting that these cells were not impaired in the yeast-hyphae switch. Since changes in the cell wall can also lead to changes in the ability of C. albicans to adhere to surfaces, we tested the adhesion of fixed Hst 5-treated cells to epithelial monolayers after 1 h (Figure 4B). Both Hst 5 and Hst 5+Zn-treated cells had significantly (p = 0.0091, p = 0.023) increased adhesion to epithelial cells compared to C. albicans cells incubated in DMB+Zn, which adhered similarly to Ca-only control cells. Next, we measured whether increased adhesion corresponded with increased hyphal invasion of epithelial cells (Figure 4C,D). Control C. albicans cells incubated in DMB (Ca only) had invasion in 61.9% of total counts. Hyphae treated with Hst 5 had similar invasion (60.9% of total cells) while cells treated with Hst 5+Zn showed significantly decreased invasion (p < 0.01) at 47.0% of total cells. Thus, although Hst 5 and Hst 5+Zn-treated cells both had increased adherence to epithelial monolayers compared to control cells, only Hst 5+Zn treated cells had significantly reduced invasion ability.",
            "Discussion": "Fungal cells that survive exposure to antifungal drugs have altered host interactions, which are important to consider in the context of clinical treatment. A subpopulation of fungal cells can frequently survive antifungal drug treatment if the dosage or time of treatment is too low, and this can result in an enrichment of drug-adapted cells and acquired resistance over time [42]. In the case of endogenously produced Hst 5, the presence of commensal Candida in the oral environment confirms that levels in the saliva are low enough to allow a continued survival of stress-adapted C. albicans cells, even with enhanced activity due to Zn2+ binding. Therefore, it is important to understand whether these surviving cells have altered virulence and host interactions. We found that Hst 5+Zn causes profound changes in stress signaling compared to Hst 5 alone, even at doses where a majority of cells survive. We also found that an increase in the activation of the CWI pathway is a unique protective response to Hst 5+Zn which functions via CWI-dependent chitin synthesis and leads to a marked increase in the level of, and changes in the distribution of cell-wall polysaccharides. The yeast cell wall is an important contributor to osmotic balance and is therefore a factor in recovery from membrane stress [43]. Since increased CWI signaling is a known adaptation to the membrane disrupting drug Amp B [26,27], we speculate that increased cell wall chitin improves the ability of C. albicans survivor cells to recover from membrane stress due to Hst 5+Zn. An increase in surface chitin, mannan and β-1,3 glucan was observed in both Amp B and Hst 5+Zn treated C. albicans cells, suggesting that these changes were a response to drug-induced membrane damage. Fluorescence microscopy further revealed large changes in the pattern of β-1,3 glucan exposure between cells treated with Hst 5 alone or Hst 5+Zn. A change in chitin distribution toward bud scars was also noted in cells treated with Hst 5+Zn, which is likely due to post-transcriptional upregulation of chitin synthase Chs3 via the CWI pathway. Both total exposure and the geometry of cell-wall components on the cell surface govern receptor interactions and host cell recognition [44], so we hypothesized that the changes observed in chitin and β-1,3 glucan could lead to altered recognition of cell-wall PAMPs (pathogen associated molecular patterns) and host signaling in response to contact with C. albicans cells. Of the 3 cell-wall components considered in this study, β-1,3 glucan is the best understood in terms of interactions with the oral epithelia, as there is at least one known β-1,3 glucan receptor and 2 known β-1,3 glucan responsive signaling pathways [38,39], and a comparative paucity of information about the response to mannan or chitin. Therefore, we focused on aspects of oral epithelial cell (OEC) signaling which have evidence of responsiveness to fungal β-1,3 glucan: first, signaling through the receptor combination EphA2-EGFR [39]. Second, the transcription factor NF-κB which responds to various receptors but has sometimes been linked to Dectin-1 [38]. EphA2 was phosphorylated in response to Hst 5+Zn-treated cells, and NF-κB was also activated, suggesting that Hst 5+Zn-upregulated cell-wall moieties are recognized by EphA2 and at least one other receptor. The activation of EphA2 by C. albicans in OECs has previously been linked to the production of IL-8, IL-1α, IL-1β, and CCL20 [38], but this requires concurrent signaling by EGFR which was not activated by exposure to Ca+Hst 5+Zn. We found that IL-8 and IL-1β release actually decreased in OECs exposed to C. albicans treated with Hst 5+Zn compared to control (Ca only) cells, which is consistent with the observed lack of EGFR activation. However, due to the parallel activation of NF-κB despite the outcome of lower cytokine release, we suspected that this was an inhibitory signaling event to negatively regulate inflammatory cytokine production. This interpretation was supported by the results of the larger cytokine array, which showed global decreases in pro-inflammatory cytokine release in conjunction with a distinct and unique increase in levels of IL-10. The cytokine IL-10 is a negative regulator of inflammatory cytokine production by blocking nuclear localization of NF-κB, though phosphorylation of the transcription factor is unaffected [45]. This clarifies how the apparent increase in NF-κB activation was not accompanied by canonical inflammatory cytokine production. It is unclear which signaling pathway leads to upregulation of IL-10 production in epithelial cells, however fungal chitin has been shown to mediate upregulation of IL-10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells through concurrent activation of NOD2, TLR9, and mannose receptor [33]. The anti-inflammatory cytokine response to Hst 5+Zn-treated C. albicans led us to question whether these cells were more or less virulent. We assayed three aspects of fungal virulence using an OEC model. Hyphal length after 30 min was no different between C. albicans cells treated with DMB+Zn, Hst 5, or Hst 5+Zn, indicating that Hst 5+Zn survivor cells have no defect in the yeast-hyphae switch. Both Hst 5 and Hst 5+Zn survivor cells had increased adhesion to OEC monolayers compared to DMB+Zn treated controls, suggesting that these cells are less prone to dissemination in the oral environment. Since adhesion is closely linked to the hyphal switch and fungal recognition by OECs [46], increased adhesion combined with high exposed β-1,3 glucan likely contributes to the induction of EphA2. Finally, we found that Hst 5 and Hst 5+Zn survivor cells had decreased invasion of an OEC monolayer compared to DMB-incubated control cells, and Hst 5+Zn-treated cells were significantly less invasive than Hst 5-treated cells. Thus, despite an increase in OEC signaling in response to Hst 5+Zn-treated cells, these cells are less virulent than control cells. We speculate that changes in cell surface chitin due to Hst 5+Zn treatment acts as a signal to OECs that C. albicans is growing less invasively, which results in decreased inflammatory cytokine release. This model is complimentary to a recent finding by Noble et al. (2021) that implicated the chitinase Cht2 as an important effector of commensalism in C. albicans [47]. Chitinases play a major role in cell-wall remodeling and process chitin molecules to different sizes [48], which modulates the effect on host cells [49]. The relationship between Cht2, chitin remodeling and host epithelial cell response is a topic which warrants further attention. The ability to effectively treat candidiasis is dependent upon the relationship between the drug, the oral environment, and the stress response of C. albicans. Persistent, difficult to treat fungal infections are a serious concern that can elevate minor infections to life-threatening health issues. It is of great importance to fully understand the effect of fungicidal drugs on pathogenic yeast as a means of effectively maintaining a healthy homeostasis with the oral microbiota. Hst 5 in combination with Zn has potential as both a powerful physiological mechanism to maintain C. albicans in a commensal state as well as a tool for the effective treatment of oral candidiasis.",
            "Materials and Methods": "4.1. Yeast Strains, Media, and Culture Conditions: Experiments were carried out with C. albicans strain SC5314. Additional experiments were carried out with isogenic mutants mkc1/mkc1 and chs4/chs4 in parent strain SN152 (his1Δ/his1Δ, leu2Δ/leu2Δ, arg4Δ/arg4Δ, URA3/ura3Δ::imm434, IRO1/iro1Δ::imm), and reference strain SN250 (his1Δ/his1Δ, leu2Δ::C.dubliniensis HIS1/leu2Δ::C.maltosa LEU2, arg4Δ/arg4Δ, URA3/ura3Δ::imm434, IRO1/iro1Δ::imm43), derived from an SC5314 background [50]. Yeast-Peptone-Dextrose (YPD) media was used to culture yeast cells and YPD-Agar solid media was used for colony growth (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All YPD media was prepared in deionized water with 50 μg/ mL supplemented uridine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Briefly, C. albicans was cultured by inoculating a single colony into 20 mL YPD and grown 16 h at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm. Cultures were then diluted to OD600 of 0.3–0.4 and re-cultured to OD600 = 0.9–1.0. Cells were washed twice in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (NaPB) (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) prepared in HPLC water (JT Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA). Cells were then diluted in NaPB to OD600 = 0.53–0.54 (1 × 106 cells/mL) for candidacidal assay or OD600 = 0.99–1.0 (1 × 107 cells/mL) for use in all other experiments. Metal salt solutions of ZnSO4·7H2O (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were made in HPLC-grade water (JT Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA). For MAPK activation and survivor cell experiments, dilute media buffer (DMB) consisting of Yeast Nitrogen Base media (0.17% YNB-ZnSO4 [Sunrise Science Products, Knoxville, TN, USA]/ 0.5% (NH4)SO4 [Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA]/ 2% Glucose [Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA]) was prepared for use at a 25% dilution in 75% 10 mM NaPB. 4.2. Peptides: Histatin 5 (Hst 5) primary sequence (DSHAKRHHGYKRKFHEKHHSHRGY), and Histatin 5ΔMB (Hst 5 ΔMB) (QQQAKRHHGYKRKFQQQQQSHRGY that replaced both the N-terminal ATCUN motif (AA 1–3) and HExxH motif (AA 15–19) with glutamines) were synthesized by Genemed Synthesis, INC. (San Antonio, Texas, USA). Peptides were handled as previously described. A total of 36 mM Amphotericin B (Amp B) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was prepared in 100% DMSO, and 3.6 mg/mL Caspofungin (CasF) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was prepared in ddH2O. 4.3. Cell Survival Assays: Peptides (3.15 fmol/cell Hst 5 or Hst 5ΔMB) or an equal volume of NaPB buffer were mixed with or without 1.58 fmol/cell Zn2+, then incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. C. albicans SC5314 cells were added to samples at 1 × 107 cells/mL in DMB. Cells and peptides were incubated at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm for 1 h. C. albicans cells were diluted in NaPB and plated on YPD-Agar. SN250 cells and deletion mutants were cultured as described above. Hst 5 (0.75 fmol/cell) or an equal volume of NaPB buffer was mixed with or without Zn2+ (37.5 fmol/cell), then incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Aliquots of 2 × 105 cells were added to samples and were incubated at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm for 1 h, diluted in NaPB, and plated on YPD-Agar. Cell survival was calculated by dividing colony counts of sample conditions by untreated controls. Percent killing was determined by taking the compliment of cell survival. Statistical differences between cell survival were calculated using ordinary one-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison test. 4.4. C. albicans MAPK Phosphorylation: C. albicans SC5314 cells were cultured as described above. Peptides (0.79 fmol/cell) or an equal volume of NaPB buffer were pre-incubated for 30 min with or without 0.40 fmol/cell Zn2+. C. albicans SC5314 cells were added to pre-incubated samples at 1 × 107 cells/mL in DMB buffer. Cells were incubated for 5, 15 or 30 min at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm before being harvested at 2500× g, then washed in 10 mM NaPB. Cell pellets were stored at −80 °C. Cells were lysed as previously described [20], and 7.2–7.5 μg protein was loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto PVDF (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA). After transfer, membranes were blocked for 1 h at 25 °C in 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (0.5 g BSA/10 mL TBS/T), followed by washing with TBS/T. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight in 5% BSA TBS/T. Cek1 and Mkc1 phosphorylation were both detected using anti-phospho p42/44 MAPK ERK1/2 Thr202/Tyr204 rabbit polyclonal antibody as the primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA). Hog1 phosphorylation was detected using an anti-phospho p38 MAPK Thr180/Tyr182 (D3F9) primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA). Actin was detected using an anti-beta-actin polyclonal antibody (Bioss, Woburn, MA, USA). Membranes were then incubated with Goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA) secondary antibodies at 25 °C for 1 h in 5% BSA TBS/T. Chemiluminescent signals were generated using the SuperSignal West Pico detection kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and detected using a ChemiDoc MP system (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA). 4.5. Analyses of C. albicans Cell Wall Components: Antimicrobial agents were mixed in NaPB buffer (amphotericin B [0.05 fmol/cell]; caspofungin [0.26 fmol/cell]; Hst 5 and Hst 5ΔMB [3.15 fmol/cell], ± Zn2+ [1.58 fmol/cell]; or an equal volume of NaPB buffer) and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. SC5314 cells were cultured as described above and added to samples at 1 × 107 cells/mL in DMB buffer, then incubated for 3 h at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm. After incubation, cells were centrifuged at 2500× g at 4 °C and washed in NaPB. Samples were then fixed in 100% methanol for 20 min on ice (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Fixed cells were centrifuged at 2500× g at 4 °C and washed in FCM staining buffer 0.5% BSA (Leinco Technologies, Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA). Staining of β-1,3 glucan was carried out with 1 mg/mL (1–3)-beta-glucan-directed monoclonal antibody (Biosupplies Australia Ltd., Bundoora, Australia) at 25 °C for 20 min with rocking before a 5 m incubation on ice. Cells were then washed 2 times at 2500× g, 4 °C. The secondary, anti-mouse IgG (H+L), F(ab’)2 Fragment (Alexa Fluor® 647 Conjugate) (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA) was then added at a 1:50 dilution and cells were incubated on ice for 15 min. Samples were again washed 2 times at 2500× g, 4 °C and resuspended in FCM for flow cytometry. Mannan staining was carried out with 25 μg/mL Concanavalin A, Alexafluor 488 conjugate (ConA-488) (Life Technologies Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA). Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 45 min with shaking at 220 RPM, then washed once at 2500× g, 4 °C, before being resuspended in FCM for flow cytometry. Chitin staining was completed using 25 μg/mL Calcofluor White (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) Cells were allowed to sit at 25 °C for at least 1⁄2 h before flow cytometry was carried out. 4.5. Analyses of C. albicans Cell Wall Components: Flow cytometry was carried out using the BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer. All treatment conditions were repeated on at least 3 separate days and average fluorescence intensity of at least 10,000 events was divided by the averages for same-day control cells incubated 3 h in either DMB or DMB+Zn. Baseline fluorescence intensity was set to 1. Statistical differences in average fluorescence intensity between control and treatment conditions (Hst 5 vs. Hst 5+Zn, Hst 5ΔMB vs Hst 5ΔMB+Zn, Media treated cells vs. Amp B or CasF) were calculated using unpaired t-tests. For fluorescent microscopy, C. albicans cells were stained as for flow cytometry and suspended in SlowFadeTM Gold Antifade Mountant (Life Technologies Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA). Samples were mounted on 25 × 75 mm microscope slides (Globe Scientific, Inc., Mahwah, NJ, USA) with 18 × 18 mm #1.5 cover glass (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and sealed with nail polish. Images were acquired using an Andor Dragonfly spinning-disk confocal microscope (Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK). 4.6. Oral Epithelial Signaling in Response to the Fungal Cell Wall: SC5314 cells were cultured as above. Hst 5 (3.15 fmol/cell) or an equal volume of NaPB buffer, ± 1.58 fmol/cell Zn2+ was pre-mixed and incubated for 30 min at 25  C. Cells were added to pre-mixed Hst 5 at 1 × 107 cells/mL in DMB then incubated for 3 h at 30  C with shaking at 220 rpm. then fixed in 100% methanol. TR146 buccal epithelial squamous cell carcinoma line was obtained from European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC). TR146 cells have been characterized for use as a model for the human buccal epithelial barrier [38]. TR146 cells were routinely cultured in 1:1 DMEM/ F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. For standard experiments, TR146 epithelial cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/mL in 12 well tissue culture plates or on acid washed 15 mm diameter glass coverslips previously placed in 12 well cell culture plates and cultured until the cells were confluent. Fixed C. albicans cells were seeded onto confluent epithelial cell monolayers at 1 × 107 cells/well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Oral epithelial cells (OECs) were lysed after treatment using 400 μL RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors, left on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 21,000× g at 4 °C. Total protein concentration was determined using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at −80 °C. For immunoblotting, total OEC lysate protein (20 μg) was separated by 12% SDS- PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk or BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in Tris Buffered Saline pH = 7.2 containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) at 20 °C for 1 h. Primary antibodies used were Phospho-NF-κB p65 (Ser536) (93H1) Rabbit mAb (1:1000), Phospho-EGF Receptor (Tyr1068) (D7A5) XP® Rabbit mAb (1:1000), and c-Fos (9F6) Rabbit mAb (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA), as well as a β-Actin Polyclonal Antibody (1:1000) (Bioss, Woburn, MA, USA). Blots were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. Membranes were washed twice with TBST and probed with Goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA) secondary antibody for 1 h at 25 °C. Secondary antibodies were detected using SuperSignal West Pico detection kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). 4.7. Cytokine Detection via ELISA and Antibody Array: SC5314 cells were cultured as above. Hst 5 (3.15 fmol/cell) or an equal volume of NaPB buffer, ± 1.58 fmol/cell Zn2+ was pre-mixed and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Cells were added to pre-mixed Hst 5 at 1 × 107 cells/mL in DMB then incubated for 3 h at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm, then fixed in 100% methanol. Fixed C. albicans cells were seeded onto confluent epithelial cell monolayers at 1 × 107 cells/well and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Supernatants from Candida treated oral epithelial cells were collected after 24 h and clarified at 21,000× g for 10 min to remove any cellular debris then frozen at −20 °C until the analysis was performed. Levels of secreted IL-1β or IL-8 in culture supernatants were determined using Human IL-1β and IL-8 ELISA MAX kits (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. SoftMax Pro ELISA analysis software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to calculate IL-1β or IL-8 concentrations using standard reference curves. Statistical differences between cytokine levels were calculated using ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. 4.7. Cytokine Detection via ELISA and Antibody Array: Culture supernatants were further applied to the RayBiotech Human Cytokine Antibody Array 5 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (RayBiotech, Inc. Norcross, GA, USA). SLIM mapping was carried out using the Generic GO Term Mapper (http://go.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/GOTermMapper, accessed on 4 November 2021) to choose cytokines with GO annotations for innate immunity and inflammatory biological processes [51]; then biologically relevant changes in OEC cytokine release due to Ca+Hst 5+Zn were set at a fold change in excess of ±0.5 compared to control. 4.8. Preparation of C. albicans Cells and TR146 Monolayers: SC5314 cells were cultured as above. Hst 5 (3.15 fmol/cell) or an equal volume of NaPB buffer, ± 1.58 fmol/cell Zn2+ was pre-mixed and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Cells were added to pre-mixed Hst 5 at 1 × 107 cells/mL in DMB then incubated for 3 h at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm. Cells were either used immediately for invasion assays and hyphal growth assays or fixed in 100% methanol for use in adhesion assays. For all of the assays, TR146 oral epithelial cells were grown to confluence on 15 mm glass coverslips for 48 h in 12 well tissue culture plates, and were serum starved overnight prior to experiments before C. albicans cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in 1 mL serum-free DMEM/F12 medium. 4.9. Invasion, Hyphal Growth and Adhesion: For the invasion assays, C. albicans seeded monolayers were prepared as described above and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. After incubation, non-adherent C. albicans cells were removed and washed once with 1 × PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde. External portions of C. albicans hyphae were fluorescently stained: C. albicans seeded monolayers were incubated with rabbit anti-Candida antibody (1:1000 in 1 × PBS; OriGene, Rockville, MD, USA) for 2 h and subsequently with a goat anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (1:2000 in 1 × PBS). Invaded hyphae were masked by the epithelial monolayer and remained unstained. Images were recorded using fluorescent and bright field channels in a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 inverted fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Experiments were carried out in triplicate and at least 10 fields and 40 hyphae per field were counted in total, then counted again for invaded hyphae (unstained). Invaded hyphae were divided by total hyphae in each field to determine percent invasion. 4.9. Invasion, Hyphal Growth and Adhesion: For hyphal growth assays, C. albicans seeded monolayers were prepared as described above and incubated for 30 min before non-adherent C. albicans cells were removed and washed five times with 1 × PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde. C. albicans cells were incubated with rabbit anti-Candida antibody (1:1000 in 1 × PBS; OriGene, Rockville, MD, USA) for 2 h and subsequently with a goat anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (1:2000 in 1 × PBS). Images were recorded using fluorescent and bright field channels in a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 inverted fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Measurements were made of at least 100 budding hyphae per sample. 4.9. Invasion, Hyphal Growth and Adhesion: For adhesion assays, C. albicans seeded monolayers were prepared as described above and incubated for 1 h before non-adherent C. albicans cells were removed and washed 3 times with 1 × PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde. C. albicans seeded monolayers were incubated with rabbit anti-Candida antibody (1:1000 in 1 × PBS; OriGene, Rockville, MD, USA) for 2 h and subsequently with a goat anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (1:2000 in 1 × PBS). Images were recorded using fluorescent and bright field channels in a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 inverted fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Images of at least 15 fields per sample were taken. Total C. albicans cells were counted in each field and averaged. Values were expressed as percent of control (Ca only) cells. 4.9. Invasion, Hyphal Growth and Adhesion: All image analyses were performed in the ImageJ software. Statistical differences between conditions were calculated using ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test for hyphal length and invasion assays, and Sidak’s test for adhesion assays. 4.10.

        "abstract": "Candida albicans is maintained as a commensal by immune mechanisms at the oral epithelia. Oral antifungal peptide Histatin 5 (Hst 5) may function in innate immunity, but the specific role Hst 5 plays in C. albicans commensalism is unclear. Since Zn-binding potentiates the candidacidal activity of Hst 5, we hypothesized that Hst 5+Zn would elicit a unique fungal stress response to shape interactions between C. albicans and oral epithelial cells (OECs). We found that Hst 5+Zn but not Hst 5 alone resulted in the activation of cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling, and deletion mutants were then used to determine that CWI-mediated chitin synthesis was protective against killing. Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that Hst 5+Zn-treated cells had significantly elevated levels of cell-wall chitin, mannan and β-1,3 glucan compared to Hst 5-treated cells. We then tested the activation of host signaling components involved in C. albicans cell-wall recognition. The immunoblot assay of C. albicans-exposed oral epithelial cells showed increased activation of EphA2 and NF-κB but not EGFR. Interestingly, C. albicans treated with Hst 5+Zn induced the global suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine release from OECs, but an increase in negative regulator IL-10. Hst 5+Zn-treated cells were more adherent but ultimately less invasive to OECs than control cells, thus indicating lowered virulence. Therefore, Hst 5+Zn-treated C. albicans cells are discerned by epithelial monolayers, but are less virulent and promote anti-inflammatory signaling, suggesting that Hst 5+Zn in combination could play a role in regulating commensalism of oral C. albicans through cell wall reorganization.",

            "Introduction": "Despite the enormous global impact of neurological disorders and the extensive research over many decades, there is still a lack of proven clinically effective pharmacological neuroprotective therapies capable of reducing the severity of brain or spinal cord tissue injury in acute (e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury, and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) or chronic (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) neurological disorders. The few neuroprotective treatments that are available, such as riluzole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and memantine for Alzheimer's disease provide only modest benefits. While hypothermia is used as a neuroprotective therapy for neonatal encephalopathy and for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, it is difficult to implement due to the need for specialized equipment and intensive patient monitoring, and its efficacy is also limited. Hence, the development of effective neuroprotective drugs for the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders remains an urgent priority. To make matters worse, due to past clinical failures, some researchers, physicians, and pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to continue research focused on the development of neuroprotective agents. However, most impartial observers would agree that the benefits of continuing to pursue the discovery of neuroprotective therapies far outweigh the risks. With this in mind, it is also intuitive that in order to increase the chances of achieving translational success at the clinical level, it is preferable that any new neuroprotective drug should have a multimodal mechanism of action. To this end, cationic arginine-rich peptides (CARPs) represent a relatively novel and expanding class of compounds, which possess an array of intrinsic neuroprotective properties, and are thus ideal molecules for development as therapies for a broad range of neurological disorders.",
            "General Aspects of CARPs": "As the name suggests, critical factors for CARP neuroprotection are their positive charge and arginine content as well as, the ability to traverse membrane lipid bilayers. Whereas, cationic charge can be imparted by the presence of the positively charged amino acids arginine and lysine (Figure 1A), which have a net charge of +1 at pH 7, arginine is the amino acid essential for neuroprotection. Histidine, the other positively charged amino acid only provides a modest contribution to peptide charge with a net charge of +0.1 at pH 7. Furthermore, CARPs represent a broader class of bioactive peptides with a number of other properties that may contribute to their neuroprotective actions, including the ability to reduce intracellular calcium influx, antagonize cell surface receptor function, target mitochondria, scavenge reactive molecules, induce cell signaling, stabilize proteins, inhibit proteolytic enzymes, and reduce inflammation, and in addition to being neuroprotective also have anti-nociceptive, cardioprotective, anti-microbial and anti-cancer properties. Positively charged amino acids arginine and lysine, and hydrogen bonding. (A) Arginine and lysine depicting positively charged guanindino head group and amino head group, respectively. (B) Arginine guanindino head groups and lysine amino head groups forming bidentate hydrogen-bonding and monodentate hydrogen-bonding, respectively, with phosphate, sulfate and carboxylate anionic moieties. CARPs have demonstrated neuroprotection in in vitro neuronal injury models (e.g., excitotoxicity, oxygen-glucose deprivation), in in vivo models of acute central nervous system (CNS) injury (e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury, perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and epilepsy) and in models of chronic neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease) and neuropathic pain (Tables 1–3). Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that neuroprotective CARPs can be categorized into three main groups; (i) poly-arginine peptides, cationic arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CCPPs) or peptides derived from proteins (Table 1); (ii) putative neuroprotective peptides fused to CCPPs (Table 2); and (iii) endogenous peptides (Table 3). CARPs with neuroprotective and other neuroactive properties. At the N-terminus, Ac indicates acetyl and at the C-terminus NH. Studies demonstrating neuroprotective and other neuroactive properties of peptides fused to TAT and other cell penetrating peptides. At the N-terminus, Ac indicates acetyl and at the C-terminus NH. Endogenous CARPs with neuroprotective and cytoprotective properties. AD, Alzheimer's disease; GCI, global cerebral ischaemia; HIE, hypoxia-ischaemia encephalopathy; ICH, intracerebral hemorrhage; LPS, Lipopolysaccharide; SAH, subarachnoid hemorrhage; SCI, spinal cord injury; PD, Parkinson's disease; stroke, ischaemic stroke; TBI, traumatic brain injury. The aim of this review is to highlight the recognition of CARPs as a novel class of peptide with great promise for the treatment of acute and chronic neurological disorders, and in so doing summarize their known neuroprotective mechanisms of action, as well as other potential actions whereby they may exert beneficial effects in injured or affected cells. Within this group of compounds are included many putative neuroprotective peptides fused to CCPPs (e.g., TAT, R9, penetratin) that have been developed (Table 2). In this review, such peptides are also classified as CARPs, and we propose that in many, if not all instances their putative neuroprotective effects may actually be mediated by the arginine content and positive charge of the carrier and/or cargo peptide, rather than the cargo peptide itself.",
            "Generic Features of Neuroprotective CARPs": "In general terms, neuroprotective CARPs typically possess the following properties: (i) range in size from 4 to 40 amino acids; (ii) positive net charge ≥ +2 to +20; (iii) one or more positively charged arginine residues that comprise between 20 and 100% of the peptide; (iv) other positively charged amino acids namely lysine and histidine; (v) amphiphilicity due to the presence of both hydrophilic (e.g., arginine, lysine) and hydrophobic (e.g., tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine) amino acids; and (vi) endocytic and/or non-endocytic cell membrane traversing properties, including the ability to cross the blood-brain and blood-spinal cord barriers (BBB/BSCB). Invariably, CARPs are commercially or chemically synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis. One exception is the CARP, protamine (Table 3), which is purified from salmon milt or generated recombinantly. Due to the capacity of CARPs to traverse cellular membranes and localize to different organs within the body, they have been the subject of several experimental and review articles examining their bioavailability (201–203) and therefore this subject is not covered in this review.",
            "Historical Overview of CARPs and Neuroprotection Studies": "Key historical events in the recognition and application of CARPs as neuroprotective agents are summarized in Figure 2. The first study to identify the neuroprotective properties of CARPs was in 1998 when Ferrer-Montiel et al. (1) screened a 6-mer peptide library containing over 49,000 different peptides for their ability to block glutamate-evoked ionic currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing the NR1 and NR2A NMDA receptor subunits. Hexapeptides containing at least two arginine (R) residues at any position as well as one or more lysine (K), tryptophan (W), and cysteine (C) residues displayed ionic current blocking activity. Further analysis revealed that C-carboxyl amidated (-NH2; note C-carboxyl amidation removes the negatively charged COO− C-terminus thereby increasing peptide net charge by +1) dipeptides RR-NH2 (net charge +3) and RW-NH2 (net charge +2) were also capable of blocking NMDA receptor activity. Similarly, certain amino acid residues within arginine-rich hexapeptides inhibited the NMDA receptor blocking ability of the peptide (e.g., RFMRNR-NH2; net charge +4, was ineffective; M, methionine; N, asparagine). In addition, increasing oligo-arginine peptide length from 2 to 6 resides (e.g., R2-NH2 vs. R3-NH2 vs. R6-NH2) increased blocking activity. In a NMDA excitotoxicity model (NMDA: 200 μM/20 min) using cultured hippocampal neurons, arginine-rich hexapeptides (Table 1), especially those also containing one or two tryptophan residues displayed high-levels of neuroprotection, and the neuroprotective action of the peptides was not stereo-selective with L- and D-isoform peptides showing similar efficacy. The ability of tryptophan to improve peptide neuroprotective efficacy is of particular interest as tryptophan residues also increase the uptake efficacy of CCPPs (204–208). Historical time-line for the recognition of CARPs as neuroprotective agents. Other observations concluded that: (i) whereas cationic arginine-rich hexapeptides were highly efficient at blocking NMDA receptor evoked ionic currents (80–100%), some peptides (e.g., RRRCWW-NH2 and RYYRRW-NH2) also blocked AMPA receptor currents by over 60%. In subsequent studies, the peptide RRRRWW-NH2 was demonstrated to antagonize the vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1; also known as the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1; TRPV1) mediated currents in a Xenopus expression system and reduce calcium influx in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons following capsaicin or resiniferatoxin VR1 receptor stimulation (2, 209). Neuroprotective Properties of Cationic Arginine-Rich Cell-Penetrating Peptides TAT, R9, and Penetratin: Shortly after the work of Ferrer-Montiel et al. (1), the CCPP TAT (see Table 1 for sequence and net charge) was demonstrated to have the capacity to transport large protein cargos across the BBB (210). Subsequently, the TAT peptide became increasingly utilized as a carrier molecule to deliver various cargos into the brain, including putative neuroprotective peptides and proteins (Figure 2). To date over fifty different TAT-fused neuroprotective peptides have been shown to have positive effects in different in vitro and/or animal CNS injury models (Table 2). However, not surprisingly in light of the Ferrer-Montiel et al. (1) findings, experiments in other laboratories demonstrated that the TAT peptide itself possesses modest neuroprotective actions in in vitro excitotoxicity and in vivo ischemic injury models (8–11). Subsequently, it was reported that the CCPPs, R9 (Table 1), and penetratin (Table 1) were 17- and 4.6-fold, respectively more neuroprotective than TAT in a severe cortical neuronal glutamic acid excitotoxicity cell death model (glutamic acid: 100 μM/5 min; Figure 3) (12). These findings also raised the first clues that the neuroprotective actions of putative neuroprotective peptides fused to CCPPs may in fact be mediated by the carrier peptide. Neuroprotective efficacy of cationic arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides in glutamic acid excitotoxicity model. Peptides present in neuronal cultures for 10 min before and during (half concentration) 5-min glutamic acid exposure. Neuronal viability measured 24 h following glutamic acid exposure. Concentration of peptide in μM. MTS assay data were expressed as percentage neuronal viability with no insult control taken as 100% viability and glutamic acid control (Glut.) taken as 5% (mean ± SE; n = 4; *P < 0.05). Adapted from Meloni et al. (12). Further Validation and Characterization of CARPs as Neuroprotective Agents: Later, in vitro studies confirmed that other CARPs (e.g., protamine, LMWP, XIP; Tables 1, 3) and long-chain poly-arginine peptides (Table 1) were also highly neuroprotective, with efficacy increasing with increasing arginine content and peptide positive charge, plateauing at around 15–18 arginine residues for arginine polymers (15, 16). Furthermore, the requirement for arginine residues, rather than lysine residues, was demonstrated to be critical for neuroprotection, with the K10 peptide (10-mer of lysine; net charge +10) displaying limited efficacy in a neuronal glutamic acid excitotoxic model (15). In addition, the importance of peptide charge was confirmed by the finding that the glutamic acid containing neutrally charged R9/E9 peptide (RRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEE; net charge 0; E = glutamic acid) displayed no neuroprotection in the excitotoxic model (15). Further Validation and Characterization of CARPs as Neuroprotective Agents: Based on the above findings, it was hypothesized that CARP neuroprotection is largely mediated by the positively charged guanidinium head-group, which is unique to arginine (Figure 1A) (note: lysine possesses a positively charged amide group; Figure 1A) (15, 109). These findings also support the notion that peptide neuroprotective efficacy appears to be correlated with the same features that are critical for the endocytic and/or non-endocytic membrane traversing properties of CCPPs (14, 15, 109, 211). It was also demonstrated in an in vitro glutamic acid excitotoxicity model that the hydrophobic aromatic amino acids tryptophan, and to a lesser extent phenylalanine and tyrosine can significantly improve CARP neuroprotective efficacy. In contrast, alanine and glycine resides reduce peptide neuroprotective efficacy (15, 16). Importantly, tryptophan residues are also known to increase the cell-penetrating properties of CCPPs, providing further evidence that neuroprotection is closely linked to the peptide membrane traversing capacity of the peptides. Further Validation and Characterization of CARPs as Neuroprotective Agents: Studies have also demonstrated that a 10-min pre-treatment of neuronal cultures with CARPs induces a pre-conditioning neuroprotective response lasting up to 2–5 h post-treatment (15–17). Similar to the findings of Ferrer-Montiel et al. (1), it was also observed that there was no stereo-selectivity in terms of neuroprotective efficacy of L- and D-enantiomer CARPs, which suggests that with respect to neuroprotection, peptide electrostatic interactions are more important than peptide structural interactions of the peptide with specific biological targets. Importantly, CARPs have the capacity to significantly inhibit neuronal intracellular calcium influx in the glutamic acid excitotoxicity model (15–17, 109). Further Validation and Characterization of CARPs as Neuroprotective Agents: Consistent with in vitro findings, CARPs (e.g., R9D, R12, R18, R18D, protamine; Tables 1, 3) were also demonstrated to provide significant neuroprotection and improve functional outcomes in rat models of permanent and/or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), perinatal hypoxia-ischemia and traumatic brain injury (15, 16, 18–24, 212) and a non-human primate MCAO stroke model (26). Positive neuroprotective effects with R9D and R18D, which are the D-enantiomers of R9 and R18, also confirmed the lack of stereo-specificity for CARP efficacy in vivo. Further Validation and Characterization of CARPs as Neuroprotective Agents: In 2015, Marshall et al. (14) also confirmed the in vivo neuroprotective properties of CARPs including poly-arginine R7 (Table 1), as well as the TAT and TAT-NR2B9c (also known as NA-1; Table 2) peptides in rat retinal ganglion cells exposed to NMDA (20 nmol; 3 μL intravitreal injection). The study also demonstrated that CARPs containing a terminal cysteine residue improved neuroprotective efficacy; this could be due to the cysteine residue improving peptide stability and/or enhancing anti-oxidant properties. Marshall et al. (14) also considered that it was likely that the cell-penetrating properties of the CARPs along with the guanidinium head group of arginine and peptide positive charge were the “driving force” for neuroprotection. Furthermore, and as proposed by Meloni et al. (211), Marshall et al. (14) also suggested that cargo peptides designed to inhibit cell death following NMDA excitotoxicity (e.g., peptides CN2097; CKNYKKTEV and NR2B9c; KLSSIESDV) and fused to a CCPP (e.g., R7 for CN2097 and TAT for NR2B9c) were unlikely to be the active component mediating neuroprotection in the retinal ganglion cell NMDA excitotoxic injury model. Further Validation and Characterization of CARPs as Neuroprotective Agents: In 2017, McQueen et al. (110) re-evaluated the neuroprotective mechanism of action of the death-associated protein kinase 1 protein (DAPK1) blocking peptide TAT-NR2Bct (Table 2) and its scrambled control TAT-NR2Bcts (Table 2). DAPK1 is a calcium-calmodulin regulated protein activated in neurons following NMDA receptor over-stimulation as occurs in ischemia mediated excitotoxicity. TAT-NR2Bct was designed to competitively inhibit activated DAPK1 binding to the NR2B subunit protein, and thereby block subsequent downstream damaging cellular events caused by NMDA receptor over-activation. Interestingly, Meloni et al. (109) had earlier examined the TAT-NR2Bct and TAT-NR2Bcts peptides and demonstrated high neuroprotective efficacy for both peptides in the glutamic acid excitotoxicity model. Therefore, it was not surprising that McQueen et al. (110) also found that both TAT-NR2Bct and TAT-NR2Bcts, along with a randomly designed CARP (RRRTQNRRNRRTSRQNRRRSRRRR; net charge +15) were neuroprotective in a neuronal NMDA excitotoxicity model. On the basis of their findings they concluded that neuroprotection was dependent on peptide positive charge and independent of peptide sequence and DAPK1 signaling. Further Validation and Characterization of CARPs as Neuroprotective Agents: Taken together, the above studies provide irrefutable evidence of the neuroprotective properties of CARPs in various experimental situations and in doing so, raise two important issues in regard their application in neuroprotection: (i) what are the precise neuroprotective mechanisms operating; and (ii) the need to re-evaluate studies using CARPs and CCPPs for the delivery of neuroactive cargos into the CNS, particularly putative neuroprotective peptides. Both these topics are discussed below. Also, because it is likely that CARPs interact with negatively charged cell membrane structures, an interaction that appears to be critical for neuroprotection, the mechanisms associated with the affinity of CARPs to cell membranes will also be discussed. Interestingly, it is the interaction of CARPs with negatively charged bacterial and cancer cell cytoplasmic membrane structures that is considered to be one of the mechanisms responsible for their anti-bacterial and anti-cancer properties (213, 214).",
            "Putative Neuroactive Peptides Fused to Cationic Arginine-Rich Cell-Penetrating Peptides and Neuroprotection": "Given that CARPs possess intrinsic neuroprotective properties raises questions regarding the mode of action of other putative neuroprotective peptides when they are fused to a carrier CCPP (Table 2). As alluded to above, it is likely that the neuroprotection provided by such putative neuroprotective peptides fused to CCPPs, is mediated not by the actions of the cargo molecule per se, but by the carrier itself with potency being further enhanced by the amino acid content (e.g., arginine, lysine, cysteine, and tryptophan resides) and/or stability provided by the cargo peptide. In essence, a putative neuroprotective peptide fused to an arginine-rich cell-penetrating carrier peptide will possess the properties of a CARP; the only exception being if a negatively charged cargo peptide neutralizes the positive charge of the carrier peptide. In 2015 we published a review article (109) highlighting the likelihood of the neuroprotective mechanism of action of putative neuroprotective peptide fused to cell-penetrating carrier peptides being mediated by the carrier molecule. Three of the most commonly used TAT-fused neuroprotective peptides TAT-NR2B9c, TAT-JNKI-1 and TAT-CBD3, as well as several other less characterized TAT-fused peptides (e.g., TAT-p53DM, TAT-s-p53DM, TAT-NR2Bct, TAT-NR2Bcts, Indip/IndipK-R) were analyzed based on theoretical grounds, and on our own and other previous experimental studies in relation to neuroprotective mechanism of action. Following this analysis, we provided several lines of evidence to support the view that TAT-fused neuroprotective peptides are behaving as neuroprotective CARPs, and not by the proposed intended mechanism of action of the cargo peptide. This evidence included: (1) the ability of the peptides to reduce intracellular calcium influx, even though this was never an intended mechanism of action of the cargo peptide; (2) despite targeting intracellular proteins, the peptides often reduced surface expression or interfered with plasma membrane ion channel receptors; (3) lack of efficacy and inability of the peptide to reduce neuronal calcium influx when introduced directly into the cell; (4) improved peptide efficacy when TAT was replaced with R9 (increasing peptide positive charge and arginine content) or replacing neutral or negatively charged amino acids with positively charged arginine or lysine; (5) decreased peptide efficacy when replacing amino acids with alanine, which is known to reduce membrane traversing properties of cell-penetrating peptides; (6) demonstrating neuroprotective properties of CCPP-fused scrambled cargo control peptides; and (7) due to endosomal entrapment and/or peptide degradation it is possible cargo peptides have a limited capacity to interact with their intended intracellular target. Importantly, the subsequent studies of Marshall et al. (14) and McQueen et al. (110) (described above) further validate the view that the mechanism of action of TAT-fused neuroprotective peptides is likely to be mediated by the carrier peptide, and by extension the arginine content and positive charge of the peptide. In order to confirm the specific action of a neuroactive peptide cargo fused to a carrier CCPP, we recommend that the neuroprotective or other intended neuroactive actions of the peptide should be reassessed after the introduction of arginine substitutions into the cargo peptide. The introduction of arginine residues into the cargo peptide should abolish the proposed/intended neuroprotective action of the cargo peptide. However, if the action of the carrier-cargo peptide is maintained or enhanced it is likely that the neuroprotective action of the peptide was mediated by the cationic and arginine-rich properties of the peptide. Alternatively, the peptide could be synthesized in the same amino acid sequence (as opposed to retro-inversely) with D-isoform amino acids, which would drastically alter the peptide's steric structure and binding specificity/affinity to its intended target, whereas its electro-physiochemical properties would be similar. Finally, the CCPP carrier molecule could be replaced with a non-arginine containing cell-penetrating peptide (e.g., TP10 or MAP).",
            "CARPs and Their Interaction With Cellular Membranes": "CARPs have the capacity to form electrostatic interactions with anionic phosphate, sulfate and carboxylate moieties (Figure 1B) present on structures found in the plasma membrane and in membranes of cellular organelles (e.g., mitochondria, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi, endosomes). These anionic chemical moieties are located within membrane proteoglycans (heparin sulfate proteoglycans: HSPGs; chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans: CSPGs; dermatan sulfate proteoglycans: DSPGs; keratin sulfate proteoglycans: KSPGs), glycoproteins, glycosphingolipids, and phospholipids as well as negatively charged aspartate and glutamate residues within protein receptors and other protein structures embedded in cellular membranes (Supplementary Table 1). Negatively charged phosphate groups are a component of phospholipids that make-up cellular membrane bilayers (e.g., plasma membrane, inner and outer mitochondrial membrane, nuclear membrane, and endoplasmic reticulum membrane). There are at least five negatively charged membrane phospholipids including the mitochondrial membrane specific phospholipid cardiolipin, which possess a net charge of between −1 to −4 at pH 7 (Supplementary Table 1). Proteoglycans a type of glycoprotein found on the surface of most cells and consist of a protein core and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are long un-branched polysaccharides consisting of a repeating disaccharide subunit. Negatively charged sulfate groups are located on the polysaccharide repeating disaccharide subunits. In addition, the monosaccharide sialic acid is located at the end of the sugar chains attached to glycoproteins and has a negatively charged carboxyl group. Glycoproteins have important cellular functions, such as cell surface ligand receptor binding, cell signaling, cell adhesion, endocytosis, and binding extracellular matrix molecules (e.g., growth factors, enzymes, protease inhibitors, chemokines). Glycolipids consist of a membrane lipid moiety covalently attached to a monosaccharide or polysaccharide. Glycolipids, namely glycosphingolipids, are negatively charged due to the presence of sialic acid. A glycosphingolipid containing one or more sialic acid residues is also known as a ganglioside. Gangliosides are expressed on most cells, but are more abundantly expressed on the cell surface of neurons, and are found ubiquitously throughout the CNS (215). They play a key role in modulating ion channel function, receptor signaling, cell-to-cell recognition and adhesion and regulation of neuronal excitability (216, 217). Membrane protein receptors rich in the acidic amino acids aspartate and glutamate also possess a negatively charged carboxylic moiety on their side chain. With respect to the interaction of CARPs with anionic moieties, the positively charged arginine guanidinium head group forms bidentate hydrogen bonds with sulfates, carboxylates and phosphates, whereas the positively charged lysine amide head group forms weaker monodentate hydrogen bonds (Figure 1B). In addition, arginine and lysine cationic side chains can form salt bridges with the negatively charged aspartate and glutamate carboxylate C-termini, and cation-π interactions with the aromatic amino acids tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine in proteins (218, 219). Interestingly, many neurotransmitters and drug-receptor interactions involve cation-π interactions (219). Together, the different electrostatic interaction between CARPs and plasma membrane structures can induce cellular uptake of the peptide by endocytic and non-endocytic pathways (220–224). Furthermore, peptide charge, arginine content and arginine distribution within the peptide, and the extent and density of the negatively charged moieties present on the cell surface play a significant role in terms of uptake efficacy (225–227). Peptide positive charge and arginine guanidinium head groups are also critical elements responsible for the ability of CARPs to target organelle membranes, such as the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, which contain the negatively charged phospholipids cardiolipin (charge −2) and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2; charge −4) (Supplementary Table 1). Importantly, studies have demonstrated that peptide characteristics that are known to increase the cell membrane traversing properties of CARPs, such as arginine content, peptide charge and presence of the aromatic amino acid tryptophan are also linked to increased peptide neuroprotective potency (1, 15, 16, 211).",
            "Endogenous CARPs and Neuroprotection": "The endogenous PACAP38 peptide is a member of the secretin/glucagon/growth hormone-releasing hormone superfamily, and its neuroprotective properties have been discussed above. Dynorphins are widely distributed in the CNS and consist of two main peptides dynorphin A (Table 3) and dynorphin B (Table 3) that bind the κ-opioid receptor to induce analgesia (359). Interestingly, many other synthetic CARPs also have analgesic properties (see Tables 1, 2). Dynorphin A and dynorphin B are synthesized as the precursor protein predynorphin, which is then proteolytically cleaved to the smaller peptides. The dynorphin A peptide has also been shown to be neuroprotective in a rat stroke model (177). Similarly, different classes of endogenous anti-microbial peptides (e.g., defensins, cathelicidins, bactenecin) have been derived from mammals, many of which are cationic and arginine-rich. Anti-microbial peptides are mainly produced by leukocytes and act as a defense against bacteria, fungi and viruses, and act either directly or by modulating inflammatory responses. Interestingly, several cationic arginine-rich anti-microbial peptides have also been shown to have neuroprotective properties in stroke, perinatal hypoxia-ischemia and traumatic brain injury animal models (Table 2).",
            "Compounds Containing the Guanidinium Moiety and Neuroprotection": "As mentioned above, arginine is unique in possessing a guanidinium head group, and most likely the critical element imparting the neuroprotective properties of CARPs. It is therefore not surprising that compounds containing the guanidinium moiety including arginine, arginine-based NOS inhibitors (e.g., L-NNA, L-NAME), the drugs metformin, phenformin, amiloride, and aminoguanidine, the toxin tetrodotoxin and the endogenous neuroactive molecule agmatine have neuroprotective properties in in vitro neuronal injury models (e.g., excitotoxicity, oxygen-glucose deprivation) and in animal models of stroke, perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease (Supplementary Table 3). It is thus conceivable that CARPs and other guanidinium moiety containing small molecules, at least in part, share the same neuroprotective mechanism of actions including anti-excitotoxic properties. In support of their anti-excitotoxic properties different guanidinium moiety containing molecules have been demonstrated to inhibit voltage gated and ligand-gated ion channels (230–237). However, because CARPs are multivalent guanidinium-agents they are likely to possess greater potency at the molar level than molecules that contain only one or several guanidine moieties, and have a greater capacity to traverse cell membranes. Metformin and phenformin are biguanindine anti-hyperglycemic agents, which have been used for the treatment of diabetes for over 50 years. Like CARPs, metformin can activate AMPK signaling, target and suppress mitochondrial ROS production, limit calcium induced intracellular toxicity, scavenge methylglyoxal and reduce neuroinflammation (269). Aminoguanidine can also scavenge methylglyoxal and other dicarbynols (25). Agmatine is an endogenous divalent cationic guanidine. In the brain it is considered a putative neurotransmitter, in which it can be released from synaptic vesicles following membrane depolarization. It binds to various receptors (e.g., α2 adrenergic receptor) and can block NMDA receptors and other cation ligand-gated channels, with studies indicating that agmatine binds to the receptor near the channel pore and that the guanidinium group is critical for binding (360). Arginine-based nitric oxide inhibitors, such as L-NNA and L-NAME are commonly used in in vitro excitotoxic and animal stroke studies to determine the neurodamaging role of nitric oxide over-production in neuronal death and ischemic brain tissue injury. However, given the potential anti-excitotoxic action of the guanidine moiety, it is possible that arginine-based NOS inhibitors in the setting of excitotoxicity are actually suppressing the activation of NMDA receptors and ion voltage gated channels, thereby indirectly rather than directly inhibiting NOS activation. There are several lines of evidence that support this hypothesis. Following excitotoxicity, it is difficult to imagine that by blocking neuronal nitric oxide production, but not the toxic intracellular influx of calcium is able to provide high level neuroprotection (361). In addition, arginine-based NOS inhibitors are not readily taken up by cells and possess slow NOS binding kinetics (362), but are neuroprotective when added at the same time as the excitotoxic agent, which favors an extracellular (i.e., cell surface) rather than an intracellular (i.e., NOS) mechanism of action. In addition, L-NAME is a weak NOS inhibitor, which is hydrolyzed by ubiquitous esterases to the more potent L-NNA, thus requiring additional time for the inhibitor to exert its NOS inhibitory effects.",
            "Concluding Remarks": "There is now overwhelming evidence from experimental studies that CARPs represent a novel class of neuroprotective agent with great potential for the treatment of neurological disorders. However, only two CARPs with neuroprotective properties (TAT-NR2B9c/NA-1 and CN-105) have so far progressed to clinical trials for a neurological condition (363–365). Further studies are required to obtain a more complete understanding of the neuroprotective mechanisms of action of CARPs in acute CNS injury and chronic neurodegenerative disease models. Despite this, based on experimental studies to date it appears that CARPs have the potential to be developed as therapeutics for the treatment of a diverse range of neurological disorders including stroke, perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury as well as, epilepsy and pain, and potentially even chronic degenerative neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Importantly, CARPs have properties that greatly enhance the likelihood of translational success at the clinical level including possessing a pluripotent mechanism of action, the capacity to enter the CNS, and the ability to exert a broad range of beneficial extracellular, intracellular and intra-organelle effects. Based on human studies with TAT-fused peptides, such as TAT-NR2B9c/NA-1 (366), the poly-arginine peptide R9/ALX40-4C (367), and arginine-rich peptides CN-105 (365), protamine (368) and RD2 (369), it appears this class of peptide has a favorable safety profile. Moreover, our recent experimental neuroprotection study with the poly-arginine peptide R18 in a non-human primate stroke model (26), has not disclosed any neurological or other toxic effects, which also augurs well for the translational potential of other CARPs to the clinical arena. With respect to previous studies using cationic and arginine-rich peptides including those fused to a CCPP in neuroprotective, neuroactive or cytoprotective studies we believe that due to the cofounding effects of peptide positive charge and arginine residues, the mechanisms of action of theses peptides need to be critically re-evaluated. Finally, given that CARPs with different amino acid sequences or modifications will have different physio-chemical and biological properties, future studies should focus on examining if new CARPs with more targeted molecular mechanisms of actions can be designed to improve therapeutic efficacy for specific neurological disorders.",
            "CARPs Have Multimodal Neuroprotective Mechanisms Of Action_0": "Data obtained in our laboratory and others using neuronal and non-neuronal cells indicate that CARPs have multimodal mechanisms of action targeting cell surface ion channel receptors and other receptors, mitochondria, proteolytic enzymes, oxidative stress/free radical molecules, protein stability, and pro-survival signaling, as well as having anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory actions (Figure 4). Evidence supporting these different neuroprotective mechanisms is provided below. Schematic representation of CARP neuroprotective mechanisms of action.

Inhibition of Excitotoxic Neuronal Death and Excitotoxic Neuronal Calcium Influx: Our laboratory has established that CARPs are highly effective at reducing excitotoxic neuronal death and that they have the capacity to reduce glutamic acid induced neuronal calcium influx (9, 10, 15, 19, 109). These findings provide a mechanism in which CARPs inhibit glutamate-evoked ionic currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing NMDA receptors (1), and NMDA excitotoxic neuronal death in neuronal cultures in vitro and retinal ganglion cells in vivo (14, 59, 69, 110). In addition, other CARPs reduce potassium depolarization-induced calcium-influx (e.g., R9-CBD3-A6K, TAT-L1, TAT-ct-dis) and sodium currents and sodium influx (e.g., t-CSM) in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons (see Supplementary Table 2 for details). Inhibition of Excitotoxic Neuronal Death and Excitotoxic Neuronal Calcium Influx: The ability of CARPs to reduce glutamate receptor and other receptor mediated intracellular neuronal calcium influx is likely to be a primary mechanism accounting for their neuroprotective efficacy in protecting neurons in injury models associated with excitotoxicity and excessive neuronal intracellular calcium influx. As a mechanism whereby CARPs act to reduce the intracellular influx of calcium and potentially other ions, we hypothesized (109) that CARPs have the capacity to induce the endocytic internalization of cell surface ion channel receptors (Figure 4). In support of this hypothesis we subsequently showed that R12, as well as the TAT-fused neuroprotective peptide TAT-NR2B9c, reduces neuronal cell surface expression of the glutamate receptor subunit protein, NR2B (228). Importantly, several CCPPs (e.g., TAT, penetratin, R9) have also been demonstrated to reduce TNF (tumor necrosis factor) and EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptors in non-neuronal cells via an endocytic internalization mechanism (Supplementary Table 2) (229). Interaction With Membrane Ion Receptors/Channels/Transporters: Many other studies have described the ability of CARPs to reduce neuronal and non-neuronal cell surface levels and/or activity of NMDA receptors, and other ion and non-ion channel receptors (see Supplementary Table 2). While these studies provide ample evidence for the ability of CARPs to perturb cell surface receptors it raises the question how different peptides with diverse amino acid sequences possess the ability to reduce cell surface levels and/or antagonize receptor function. As mentioned above, one mechanism involves CARP induced internalization of cell surface receptors. However, it is also possible CARPs antagonize ion channel receptor function by electrostatic interactions. For example, CARP electrostatic interactions with receptor anionic moieties may alter receptor function or interfere with ion transport within the receptor pore. In support of this, the guanidine moiety in arginine residues and in other molecules play a critical role in voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channel function (see section Compounds Containing the Guanidinium Moiety and Neuroprotection) (230–237). For example, the guanidino moiety in agmatine, a molecule with neuroprotective properties (Supplementary Table 3), has been identified as being capable of interacting with a site within the NMDA receptor channel and calcium voltage channels and blocking their function (238). Interestingly, polyamines (e.g., putrescine and spermine) a class of compounds that also contain positively charged amino groups also have the capacity to block ion channels, including glutamate receptor and potassium channels (239). Given that positive charge is a critical factor for CARP neuroprotection and charge is independent of peptide amino acid sequence, provides additional support for a mechanism involving an electrostatic interaction perturbing ion channel function. Hence, there is good evidence to indicate that the structure and charge of the guanidine moieties in CARPs have the capacity to block ion channel receptor function, providing an additional mechanism whereby the peptides can reduce the toxic effects of intracellular ion influx associated with excitotoxicity and ion channel over-stimulation. Mitochondrial Targeting and Maintenance of Mitochondrial Integrity: CARPs have the capacity to target mitochondria and exert positive effects on the organelle, with potential neuroprotective outcomes. This topic has been the subject of several reviews by the developers of the mitochondrial targeting SS cationic arginine-containing tetrapeptides (240), and more recently by our own laboratory (241), and therefore will be discussed only briefly here. Mitochondrial Targeting and Maintenance of Mitochondrial Integrity: After entering cells, CARPs target and enter mitochondria due to the presence in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes of negatively charged phospholipids (e.g., cardiolipin, PIP2), and because of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm). It is also possible that electrostatic interactions of CARPs with negatively charged free mitochondrial DNA contributes to the retention of the peptides in the organelle. At the site of the outer mitochondrial membrane, CARPs can inhibit the toxic influx of calcium into mitochondria, possibly by perturbing ion channel receptors (e.g., MCU, VDAC, NCX) and other membrane proteins (e.g., mitochondrial permeability transition pore proteins) responsible for the movement of calcium ions into mitochondria. Mitochondrial Targeting and Maintenance of Mitochondrial Integrity: CARPs can also perturb other outer membrane proteins that are detrimental to mitochondrial function and cell survival. For example, CARPs interfere with BAX, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and other pro-apoptotic proteins that localize to the outer mitochondrial membrane during cell death or interfere with proteins that promote mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission enables maintenance of mitochondria as filamentous structures, which enables toxic products generated by dysfunctional mitochondria to be distributed over a large organelle volume and thereby minimizing any detrimental effects. Furthermore, due to their interactions with cardiolipin, CARPs assist in stabilizing and preserving cristae architecture and the electron transport chain with positive effects on ATP maintenance, reduced reactive nitrogen species/reactive oxygen species (ROS/RNS) generation, as well as maintenance of cytochrome c native tertiary structure, function, oxidation state and location within the inner mitochondrial membrane. In addition, the anti-oxidant and free radical scavenging properties of CARPs (discussed below) would also have positive influences in reducing the toxic effects of excessive ROS/RNS generation by mitochondria during cellular stress. Anti-oxidant and Free Radical Scavenging Properties: Due to the amino acid arginine, CARPs are likely to act as anti-oxidant and/or free radical scavenging molecules in their own right. Although L-arginine is utilized by nitric oxide synthase as a substrate for nitric oxide generation, which is a key regulator of endothelial cell function and blood flow, the amino acid has other properties. Arginine is unique in possessing a N-terminal guanidinium head group (Figure 1A) and guanidinium containing small molecules are known to possess properties that mitigate the effects of oxidative stress. For example, L- and D-arginine, along with aminoguanidine, methylguanidine, guanidine, and creatine, which are all structurally related to arginine have the ability to scavenge one or more of the following reactive molecules: superoxide, peroxynitrate, hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid, and breakdown products of lipid peroxidation (e.g., reactive aldehydes: malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal) (242–249). Anti-oxidant and Free Radical Scavenging Properties: The anti-oxidant properties of aminoguanidine, which also possesses neuroprotective actions (Supplementary Table 3), were demonstrated in vitro with the agent reducing rat retinal Muller cell hydrogen peroxide oxidant induced apoptosis, ROS production and lipid peroxidation, and in vivo by reducing the level of lipid peroxides in the vitreous of diabetic rats (246). Furthermore, both L- and D-arginine reduced oxidative impairment to myocardial contractility of perfused rat hearts subjected to oxygen radical generation (249). L- and D-arginine and L- and D-arginine polymers (e.g., poly-arginine R9) have beneficial effects on vascular endothelial cell and cardiovascular function and have anti-atherosclerotic properties (242, 250–252). These positive effects have also been observed with D-arginine containing peptides and therefore are likely to be independent of the nitric oxide pathway, as D-arginine is not readily metabolized by nitric oxide synthase. In support of this, in Caenorhabditis elegans, which lacks nitric oxide synthase (NOS), exposure to exogenous L-arginine prolongs worm lifespan under oxidative stress growth conditions (253). Anti-oxidant and Free Radical Scavenging Properties: Szeto-Schiller (SS) peptides are short tetrapeptides with alternating basic (e.g., arginine, lysine, or ornithine) and aromatic (e.g., tyrosine, dimethyltyrosine, tryptophan, or phenylalanine) amino acids, but usually containing at least one arginine and one tyrosine or dimethyltyrosine residue (240). Several SS peptides (e.g., SS-31, SS-20, mCPP-1; Table 1) have demonstrated anti-oxidant properties by way of reducing ROS levels in cells grown under normal or oxidative stress conditions. Whereas, the anti-oxidant action of SS peptides has been attributable to the tyrosine and dimethyltyrosine residues, based on the free radial scavenging properties of guanidinium containing molecules it is likely that the arginine residue also contributes to the anti-oxidant property of SS peptides. Anti-oxidant and Free Radical Scavenging Properties: Larger CARP's also have anti-oxidant and lipid peroxidation reducing properties. A lactoferrin derived peptide f8 (GRRRRSVQWCAVSQPEATKCFQWQRNMRKVRGPPVSCIKRDSPIQCIQ; net charge +8.7) and a casein derived peptide f12 YPYYGTNLYQRRPAIAINNPYVPRTYYANPAVVRPHAQIPQRQYLPNSHPPTVVRRP; net charge +7.2) have demonstrated anti-oxidant activity in an in vitro free radical scavenging assay (254). While both f8 and f12 are large peptides with interspersed arginine residues, molecular modeling revealed the peptides display a configuration with a highly cationic electrostatic surface, with arginine residues facing on the outside of the peptide. In addition, the human cathelicidin anti-microbial peptide LL-27 (LGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFL; net charge +5) inhibits the oxidation of low density (LDL) and high density (HDL) lipoproteins and can reduce fatty acid hydroperoxides in in vitro oxidation models (255). As demonstrated with protamine, CARPs also bind negatively charged oxidized-LDLs, inhibit their engagement to the lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), which can stimulate intracellular signaling cascades detrimental in ischemia-reperfusion cerebral injury (256, 257). Similarly, the cathelicidin PR-39 (RRRPRPPYLPRPRPPPFFPPRLPPRIPPGFPPRFPPRFP; net charge +10) protects HeLa cells from apoptotic cell death induced by the oxidizing agent tert-butyl hydroperoxide (198), and inhibits hypoxia induced cell death of endothelial cells (199). Anti-oxidant and Free Radical Scavenging Properties: Another mechanism how CARPs can reduce oxidative stress is by inhibiting the activity of the plasma membrane superoxide generating enzyme complex nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase), with one study indicating inhibition is associated with the presence of poly basic amino acid consisting of arginine, lysine or histidine motifs (258). The CARPs PR-39, PR-26 (amino acids 1–26 of PR-39; net charge +8), gp91ds-tat (Table 2), and TAT-NR2B9c all inhibit NADPH oxidase function or superoxide generation in cell free systems and/or in different cells both in vitro and in vivo (259–261). The NADPH oxidase complex consists of 5 subunits with PR-39 and PR-26 binding to the SH3 (SRC homology 3) domain within the p47phox subunit, which disrupts binding to the p22phox subunit (261). The gp91ds-tat is derived from the NADPH oxidase Nox2 cytosolic B loop (mouse Nox2; amino acids 86–94) subunit and was designed to inhibit Nox2 interacting with p47phox (260). TAT-NR2B9c inhibits the generation of superoxide and phosphorylation of p47phox in cultured neurons exposed to NMDA (259). It was concluded that inhibition of NMDA receptor-PDS-95 mediated signaling by TAT-NR2B9c prevented phosphorylation of p47phox and activation of NADPH oxidase. However, for both the gp91ds-tat and TAT-NR2B9c peptides a direct inhibitory action on NADPH oxidase associated with the arginine content and positive charge of the peptides cannot be ruled out. In addition, given all four peptides have cell-penetrating properties, it is possible that these and other CARPs disrupt the membrane assembly of NADPH oxidase units within the plasma membrane. Since superoxide generation is also associated with inflammatory responses, inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity would also contribute to the anti-inflammatory properties of CARPs. Anti-oxidant and Free Radical Scavenging Properties: While the anti-oxidant properties of CARPs need to be further investigated, available evidence suggests that arginine residues within the peptide have the potential to exert anti-oxidant and/or free radical scavenging actions. Furthermore, it could be hypothesized that the multiple arginine resides within CARPs will act as a multivalent anti-oxidant compound, which depending on the number and arrangement of the guanidinium moieties would provide considerably more potency per molecule than arginine alone or a molecule containing a single guanidine moiety. Methylglyoxal Scavenging and Glycation End-Products: Glyoxal compounds are highly reactive cell permeable dicarbonyls produced predominantly as a by-product of glycolysis, and are precursors in the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). An important dicarbonyl with respect to cellular toxicity is methylglyoxal, which reacts irreversibly with arginine and lysine residues and reversibly with cysteine resides on proteins causing functional impairment (262). Methylgyloxal also reacts with nucleic acids and lipids, and its production is associated with oxidative stress and ROS generation. The glycation of arginine and lysine by methylglyoxal forms the AGEs hydro-imidazolone, methylglyoxal-hydroimdazolone 1 (MG-H1), argpyrimidine, and MG-derived lysine dimer. In addition, to altering protein function, AGE-modified proteins interact with AGE receptors (RAGE), which stimulate the expression of inflammatory genes and ROS generation. AGEs are increased in diabetes, vascular disease, cerebral ischemia, renal failure, aging and chronic disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and liver cirrhosis. Methylgyloxal can affect mitochondrial function, up-regulate vascular adhesion molecules (e.g., P-selectin and E-selectin) that contribute to leucocyte adhesion (263), and cause glycation of the BBB vascular tight junction protein occluding (264) and the basement membrane extracellular protein fibronectin (265) resulting in altered endothelial function. Methylglyoxal Scavenging and Glycation End-Products: Given that methylglyoxal readily targets basic amino acids, it is likely that arginine (and lysine/cysteine) residues within CARPs react with and act as methylglyoxal scavengers, thereby reducing their toxic effects on intra- and extra-cellular proteins, and RAGE activation. Methylgloxal is normally detoxified by the glyoxalase system (glyoxalase-1 and glyoxalase-2), which utilizes glutathione as a co-factor, however neurons are particularly susceptible to methylgloxal due to the high glycolytic activity of the brain and the reduced capacity of the glyoxalase system in neurons. The capacity of the glyoxalase system in the brain deceases with age, especially after the fifth decade of life, and an increase in MG-H1 modified mitochondrial proteins is linked to aging and increased ROS production (266); increasing glyoxalase capacity in C. elegan increases life span in this organism (267). Furthermore, any additional stress within the brain as occurs in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, as well as in chronic neurological disorders is likely to lead to an excessive production of methylgloxal and/or reduced capacity to detoxify methylgloxal. Methylglyoxal Scavenging and Glycation End-Products: Importantly, arginine and other guanidinium containing molecules (e.g., aminoguanidine, metformin) have the capacity to scavenge methylglyoxal and prevent AGEs (268, 269). For example, at one stage aminoguanidine was being developed as a therapeutic agent for the prevention of AGEs in diabetes, and both L- and D-arginine can effectively scavenge and attenuate the harmful effects of methylgloxal on cultured endothelial cells (270). However, it is considered that small molecule methylglyoxal scavengers are not sufficiently potent and/or suffer from short half-lives to be effective in vivo. In contrast, arginine-containing penta-peptides peptides (CycK[Myr]RRRRE; Cyc, cyclic peptide; Myr, myristic acid; and myr-KRRRRE; net charge +4) also possess methylglyoxal scavenging activity (271), and CycK(Myr)RRRRE prevents methylglyoxal induced pain in mice, and is being considered as a therapy for pain and other diabetic complications associated with methylglyoxal toxicity (271). Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinase Activation and the Proteasome: Another mechanism whereby CARPs may exert a neuroprotective effect is by their ability to indirectly prevent the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by inhibiting proprotein convertase (PC) activation. Proprotein convertase consists of a family of proteolytic enzymes that cleave inactive proteins, including MMPs into an active state. Poly-arginine peptides and other CARPs are potent inhibitors of convertases, such as furin, PC1, PC4, PC5/6, and PC7 (272–276).",
            "CARPs Have Multimodal Neuroprotective Mechanisms Of Action_1": "Methylgloxal is normally detoxified by the glyoxalase system (glyoxalase-1 and glyoxalase-2), which utilizes glutathione as a co-factor, however neurons are particularly susceptible to methylgloxal due to the high glycolytic activity of the brain and the reduced capacity of the glyoxalase system in neurons. The capacity of the glyoxalase system in the brain deceases with age, especially after the fifth decade of life, and an increase in MG-H1 modified mitochondrial proteins is linked to aging and increased ROS production (266); increasing glyoxalase capacity in C. elegan increases life span in this organism (267). Furthermore, any additional stress within the brain as occurs in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, as well as in chronic neurological disorders is likely to lead to an excessive production of methylgloxal and/or reduced capacity to detoxify methylgloxal. Methylglyoxal Scavenging and Glycation End-Products: Importantly, arginine and other guanidinium containing molecules (e.g., aminoguanidine, metformin) have the capacity to scavenge methylglyoxal and prevent AGEs (268, 269). For example, at one stage aminoguanidine was being developed as a therapeutic agent for the prevention of AGEs in diabetes, and both L- and D-arginine can effectively scavenge and attenuate the harmful effects of methylgloxal on cultured endothelial cells (270). However, it is considered that small molecule methylglyoxal scavengers are not sufficiently potent and/or suffer from short half-lives to be effective in vivo. In contrast, arginine-containing penta-peptides peptides (CycK[Myr]RRRRE; Cyc, cyclic peptide; Myr, myristic acid; and myr-KRRRRE; net charge +4) also possess methylglyoxal scavenging activity (271), and CycK(Myr)RRRRE prevents methylglyoxal induced pain in mice, and is being considered as a therapy for pain and other diabetic complications associated with methylglyoxal toxicity (271). Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinase Activation and the Proteasome: Another mechanism whereby CARPs may exert a neuroprotective effect is by their ability to indirectly prevent the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by inhibiting proprotein convertase (PC) activation. Proprotein convertase consists of a family of proteolytic enzymes that cleave inactive proteins, including MMPs into an active state. Poly-arginine peptides and other CARPs are potent inhibitors of convertases, such as furin, PC1, PC4, PC5/6, and PC7 (272–276). Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinase Activation and the Proteasome: Furin is a ubiquitously expressed convertase that is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (277) and up-regulated in the ischemic brain (278, 279), and can activate MMP2, MMP3, and MMP14 (280). Furthermore, MMP3 can activate MMP1, MMP7 and MMP9, and MMP14 can activate MMP2 and MMP2 can activate MMP9 (281, 282). Significantly, following ischemic stroke MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, MMP9, and MMP14 are either up-regulated or activated in the brain. Moreover, MMP activation is associated with degradation of the neurovascular unit and BBB disruption, which in turn can result in cerebral edema, leukocyte infiltration and secondary hemorrhage after ischemia (279, 281, 282). It is also possible that proprotein convertases have other protein substrates, which when activated are potentially neuro-damaging, however this is an area that has as yet not been explored. Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinase Activation and the Proteasome: The ability of poly-arginine peptides to inhibit proprotein convertases, similar to peptide neuroprotection (15), increases with increasing polymer length (e.g., R9 > R8 > R7 > R6) (272). In addition, convertase inhibition is not stereospecific with both to L- and D-isoform peptides having the capacity to inhibit enzyme activity. The electrostatic interaction between CARPs and the negatively charged surface of convertases is believed to be the mechanism responsible for the inhibitory actions of the peptides. Interestingly, a penetratin-fused peptide (P-IQACRH: RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK-IQACRG; net charge +7.9) that mimics the active site of caspases 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 14 and acts as a competitive inhibitor for these enzymes, inhibited caspase and MMP9 activation following NMDA-induced excitotoxicity in an in vivo retinal ganglion cell injury model (283). However, the peptide also reduced NMDA-induced retinal ganglion cell death in culture and in vivo, and hence it is possible that the anti-excitotoxic properties of P-IQACRH, rather than a direct down-stream inhibition of caspases and MMP9 was responsible for blocking the activation of the enzymes. The P-IQACRH study highlights the caution that is needed when analyzing the neuroprotective actions of CARPs. Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinase Activation and the Proteasome: CARPs can also inhibit other proteolytic enzymes, such as cathepsin C (284) as well as, the activity of the proteasome (285–289). Importantly, treatments known to inhibit the proteasome, which is responsible for the degradation of short-lived cytosolic proteins, is known to reduce the severity of brain injury after stroke (290–293). Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinase Activation and the Proteasome: With respect to proteasomal inhibition, the CARP PR-39 (see above) can reversibly bind to the α7 subunit of the 26S proteasome and block degradation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor protein IκBα. Interestingly, studies utilizing PR-39 indicate that proteasomal inhibition occurs via a unique allosteric, reversible and substrate selective mechanism without inhibiting overall-proteasome proteolytic activity, which in itself could be deleterious by interfering with normal cellular processes. In contrast, mild levels of proteasome inhibition can induce a protective pre-conditioning response that can protect cells from oxidative stress (294). Similarly, ischemic pre-conditioning, which can reduce brain injury following stroke is associated with proteasomal inhibition (293). PR-39 abolished NF-κB-dependent gene expression in cultured endothelial cells exposed to TNF-α, and in the pancreases and hearts of mice following induction of acute pancreatitis and myocardial infarction, including the up-regulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (285). Other studies have also demonstrated that PR-39 can reduce infarct size and have beneficial effects on microvascular cells in myocardial reperfusion injury models by blocking proteasome-mediated degradation of IκBα (200). Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinase Activation and the Proteasome: In contrast to blocking activation of the NF-κB, inhibition of the proteasome is likely to enhance activation of the transcription factor HIF-1, which is considered one of the most critical adaptive gene expression responses to low oxygen concentrations. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 consists of the HIF-α and HIF-β subunits, the former undergoing proteasomal degradation during normoxia, and the latter being constitutively expressed. Therefore, inhibition of the proteasome will enhance and/or prolong HIF-1 activation in the brain during and following cerebral ischemia, thereby enhancing any neuroprotective actions of the transcription factor. For example, PR-39 was demonstrated to inhibit the proteasome-dependent degradation of HIF-α and stimulate angiogenesis by accelerating the formation of vascular structures in cultured endothelial cells and in vivo in the myocardium (295). A similar effect was demonstrated in the brain after stroke with a small molecule proteasome inhibitor resulting in accumulation of HIF-α and enhanced angio-neurogenesis (291). Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinase Activation and the Proteasome: Inhibition of the proteasome can also enhance the activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which regulates the expression of multiple cytoprotective genes, particularly those involved in mitigating oxidative stress (e.g., HO-1, SOD1, NAD[P]H dehydrogenase, glutathione S-transferase) (296). Under normal conditions, cytoplasmic Nrf2 is bound to kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), in which it is subject to proteasomal degradation, however oxidative stress disables keap1, allowing Nrf2 to accumulate, translocate to the nucleus and activate gene expression. Interestingly, a Nrf2 amino acid derived sequence (LQLDEETGEFLPIQ) has been developed that disrupts the Nrf2-Keap1 interaction, and when fused to TAT (TAT-14: YGRKKRRQRRR-LQLDEETGEFLPIQ; charge +4) or R7 (7R-ETGE: RRRRRRRR-LQLDEETGEFLPIQ; net charge +4) has been demonstrated to activate Nrf2 and cytoprotective gene expression in THP-1 monocyte and RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines (297, 298). Furthermore, the TAT-14 peptide modified to contain a calpain cleavage sequence (TAT-CAL-DEETGE: Table 2) increased Nrf2-regulated gene expression in the brain (299) and is beneficial when administered to rodents after global cerebral ischemia and TBI (154, 299). It remains to be determined if the Nrf2 peptides are activating Nrf2 by directly disrupting the Nrf2-Keap1 interaction or by inhibiting the proteasome. Also of interest is the demonstration that in rats, oral treatment with arginine, resulted in the up-regulation of proteins associated with the Nrf2 pathway in liver and plasma (300). Reducing the Inflammatory Response: Whereas, few studies have specifically examined neuroprotective CARPs in the setting of neuro-inflammation, this class of peptide has well-established anti-inflammatory properties that are potentially beneficial in neurodegenerative disorders. It is likely CARPs exert differential effects on the immune response by targeting both the CNS and peripheral immune responses by several mechanisms. As explained above, the ability of CARPs to inhibit the proteasome will reduce NF-κB activation and the expression of genes involved in pro-inflammatory pathways. Interestingly, the CARP AIP6 (RLRWR; net charge +3) can inhibit NF-κB activity by an alternative mechanism, by binding to and blocking NF-κβ p65 sub-unit binding to DNA and inhibiting its transcriptional activity (301). The p65 subunit is a negatively charged protein, and hence it is possible that CARPs have the capacity to interfere with this NF-κβ sub-unit through an electrostatic interaction. Similarly, because CARPs can interfere with cell surface receptors levels and/or function, it is also possible they reduce the inflammatory response associated with ligands (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, intracellular molecules) binding to receptors on immune cells. Reducing the Inflammatory Response: Proteins regulated by NF-κB and involved in the inflammatory response include cytokines (e.g., IL-1, TNF-α), chemokines (e.g., MCP-1, CXCL1) and vascular adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM-1, VAM-1) (302). To this end, NF-κB is responsible for up-regulating cerebral vascular adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, which during cerebral reperfusion promotes macrophage and neutrophil infiltration into the brain. Although the ability of CARPs to reduce vascular adhesion molecule expression in the cerebral vasculature has not been examined, PR-39 can reduce VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 protein levels in heart tissue following myocardial infarction in mice and in cultured vascular endothelial cells following exposure to TNF-α (285), and leukocyte adhesion to rat mesenteric venules after ischemia and reperfusion (303). In addition, the TAT peptide reduces the production of multiple cytokines (e.g., G-CSF, IL-6, MIP1α, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) in cultured human lung epithelial cells following protein kinase C stimulation by phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate, a stimulus associated with NF-κβ activation (304). In line with the ability of CARPs to inhibit the proteasome, TAT reduced degradation of the NF-κβ inhibitory subunit IK-κβ in lung epithelial cells following protein kinase C activation. Similarly, AIP6 demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in cultured activated macrophages by decreasing TNF-α and prostaglandin-E secretion and in a mouse model of paw inflammation reduced levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 protein in affected tissue (301). Reducing the Inflammatory Response: CARPs can also bind to oxidized phospholipids (e.g., ox-LDLs) which are known pro-inflammatory molecules and play an important role in atherosclerosis and other inflammatory disorders. Due to the high lipid content of the brain, any conditions that increase oxidative stress will generate oxidized phospholipids. Binding of CARPs to oxidized phospholipids is believed to enhance their clearance, as well as reduce their inflammatory potential and inhibitory effects on anti-oxidant enzymes associated with lipoproteins and the cell membrane (255, 305). The CARP E5 (Ac-SHLRKLRKRLLRDADDKRLA-NH2; net charge +6) was demonstrated to bind oxidized phospholipids and inhibit their pro-inflammatory function in human blood (305). In addition, pre-treatment of macrophage (RAW264.7) and endothelial (HUVEC) cell lines with the LL-27 reduces pro-inflammatory gene expression, whereas pre-incubation of oxidized phospholipid with the peptide prior to administration to mice reduces serum IL-6 and TNF-α levels (255). Similarly, the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) protein derived CARP Ac-hE18A-NH2 (Ac-RKLRKRLLRDWLKAFYDKVAEKLKEAF-NH2; net charge +6) can bind bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and reduce its inflammatory (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6 production) inducing properties in human blood and primary leukocytes and a monocyte cell line (306). Ac-hE18A-NH2 can also inhibit LPS-induced VCAM-1 expression, and reduce monocyte adhesion in HUVECs, as well as the secretion of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) from THP-1 monocyte cells exposed to LPS (307). Also, the CARP TAT-14 (see above), which while developed to activate Nrf-2, reduces TNF-α production in THP-1 monocyte cells following LPS stimulation (297). Reducing the Inflammatory Response: Other ApoE derived peptides have also demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties. The two almost identical ApoE derived peptides, ApoE-133–150 (ApoE-133–150: Ac-LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLLR-NH2; net charge +8.1) and COG-133 (Table 1) suppress cytokine expression (IL-8 or TNF-α) and other inflammatory mediators (e.g., COX or NO) in THP-1 monocytes or BV-2 microglia cells stimulated with LPS (308, 309). COG-133 treatment can suppress systemic and brain levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in mice after LPS administration (36). The COG112 peptide, which comprises COG133 fused to the CCPP penetratin (Table 2) inhibits the inflammatory response in mouse models of pathogen or injury induced colitis by reducing several pro-inflammatory mediators. For example, COG112 attenuated cytokine and chemokine expression, iNOS expression and nitric oxide production in mouse colon epithelial cell cultures and in colon tissue in mice following exposure to Citrobacter rodentium (310, 311). It was also demonstrated that COG112 inhibited NF-κB activation in colon cells and tissue following bacterial stimulation (310, 311). Reducing the Inflammatory Response: The CARP PACAP38 (Table 3), which is derived from the neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) binds the adenylate-cyclase-activating receptor stimulating adenylate cyclase and subsequently increases intracellular cAMP, which is a signaling molecule important in many biological processes. PACAP38 is a predominant cleavage product of PACAP, which exerts several functions within the CNS, including acting as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator and modulating inflammatory responses. The peptide has cell-penetrating properties (312), is widely distributed within the CNS and has neuroprotective actions in excitotoxicity, retinal ischemia, stroke and traumatic brain injury models (313–318). With respect to its anti-inflammatory actions, PACAP38 can reduce the activation of cultured primary microglia to hypoxia by inhibiting induction of nitric oxide, iNOS, and p38 as well as reducing TNF-α secretion (315). Furthermore, following traumatic brain injury, PACAP38 treatment reduces cerebral inflammation by reducing toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) up-regulation, and its downstream mediators. For example, treatment reduced TNF-α and IL-1β levels, reduced NF-κβ p65 sub-unit levels in nuclei, and increased levels of the NF-κβ inhibitory subunit IκB-α in the brain (318). Additionally, PACAP38 ablated TLR-4 up-regulation in the brain and in BV-2 microglia following exposure to the TLR-4 agonist LPS (319). Similarly, the LL-37 anti-microbial CARP (LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES; net charge +6) attenuates activation of cultured dendritic cells to different TLR ligands (320). Reducing the Inflammatory Response: The CARP dRK (rrkrrr; net charge +6; lower case indicates D-isoform amino acids) was identified based on its ability to block the interaction between VEGF and the VEGF receptor. The dRK peptide can reduce TNF-α and IL-6 production in normal peripheral blood monocytes and synovial fluid mononuclear cells of rheumatoid arthritis patients following VEGF stimulation (321). In a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis, dKR reduced paw inflammation and serum levels of IL-6 (321). While it was believed that dKR was directly inhibiting the pro-inflammatory effects of VEGF and its receptor, it is possible the peptide was inhibiting VEGF induced activation of NF-κβ. In a different collagen-induced arthritis mouse model, the CARPs IG-19 (IGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNL-NH2; net charge +5) and IDR-1018 (Table 1) both reduced the number of limbs affected, and IG-19 reduced overall disease severity (322). Subsequent examination of IG-19 treated mice revealed reduced serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ and reduced cellular infiltration and cartilage degradation in arthritic joints. Interestingly, in a more recent study, IDR-108 prolonged anti-inflammatory TGFβ gene expression and suppressed early pro-inflammatory IL-1β gene expression levels in a human endothelial cell line (EA.hy926) cultivated in a high glucose environment to induce cell stress (323). In another study, treatment of arthritic mice with a peptide developed to mimic the action of Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain-only proteins (TAT-BH3: Ac-RKKRR-O-RRR-EIWIAQELRRIGDEFNAYYAR; net charge +6) ameliorated arthritis development and reduced the number of myeloid cells in the affected joint (324). Reducing the Inflammatory Response: The CARP R9-SOCS1-KIR (RRRRRRRRR-DTHFRTFRSHSDYRRI; net charge +11.2) was developed to inhibit suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) signaling, which can result in JAK/STAT or NF-κβ activation. This peptide blocked the activation and nuclear translocation of STAT1α, STAT3, and NF-κB p65 and inflammatory effects induced by IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17A in the ARPE-19 human retinal pigment epithelial cell line (325). Topical delivery of R9-SOCS1-KIR also reduced inflammatory cell infiltration into the eye in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune uveitis. Furthermore, in a mouse model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced keratitis, R9D (Table 1) treatment reduced disease severity and concentrations of corneal TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-10, and GM-CSF (326). Reducing the Inflammatory Response: The cationic arginine-rich human beta-defensin derived peptide hBD3-3 (GKCSTRGRKCCRRKK; net charge +8) has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory actions. In a macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) pre-treatment with hBD3-3 reduced iNOS, TNF-α, and IL-6 protein expression (327).",
            "CARPs Have Multimodal Neuroprotective Mechanisms Of Action_2": "In a different collagen-induced arthritis mouse model, the CARPs IG-19 (IGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNL-NH2; net charge +5) and IDR-1018 (Table 1) both reduced the number of limbs affected, and IG-19 reduced overall disease severity (322).

Furthermore, in a mouse model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced keratitis, R9D (Table 1) treatment reduced disease severity and concentrations of corneal TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-10, and GM-CSF (326). Reducing the Inflammatory Response: The cationic arginine-rich human beta-defensin derived peptide hBD3-3 (GKCSTRGRKCCRRKK; net charge +8) has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory actions. In a macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) pre-treatment with hBD3-3 reduced iNOS, TNF-α, and IL-6 protein expression (327). In addition, mice treated with hBD3-3 and injected with LPS had reduced plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-1β and reduced neutrophil infiltration into lung regions affected by LPS induced inflammation. Finally, as NF-κβ activation is involved in iNOS, TNF-α and IL-6 expression, studies in RAW264.7 cells revealed that hBD3-3 significantly inhibited degradation of the NF-κβ inhibitory subunit IκB-α, as well as the translocation of the NF-κβ p65 subunit to the nucleus. Reducing the Inflammatory Response: CARPs may also inhibit inflammation by reducing activation of components of the complement system. Protamine (Table 1) and large poly-L-arginine peptides antagonize complement protein C5a binding to its receptor C5aR1 (or CD88) in leukocytes (328). C5aR is a transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor expressed on neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and non-myeloid cells, including liver cells and alveolar and kidney tubular epithelial cells, some classes of neurons and microglia and astrocytes. Importantly activation of the complement system following stroke/cerebral ischemia and other neurological conditions is associated with unfavorable outcomes and inhibition of C5a improves outcomes (329). Antagonism of the C5aR is thought to be due to an electrostatic interaction between the CARP and anionic sites within the receptor (328). Reducing the Inflammatory Response: In some situations, CARPs may induce pro-inflammatory responses. For example, a large poly-arginine peptide (R100; 100-mer, 12.5–13.5 kDa) can bind to TLR-4 and induce cytokine and interferon gene expression in mouse splenocytes comprising mostly of B-cells, but also T-cells and monocytes (330). The peptides ApoE-133–150 and IDR-1018 increase secretion of the cytokine MCP-1 in human blood mononuclear cells (309). In one study, IDR-1018 also increased neutrophil adherence to EA.hy926 endothelial cells and promoted neutrophil migration and cytokine production (e.g., IL-8, MCP-1, MCP-3) (331). Pro-survival Signaling: Due to the ability of CARPs to interact with cell surface receptors it appears they also have the capacity to stimulate receptor mediated pro-survival signaling pathways. The best example of CARP pro-survival signaling has been demonstrated with apelin peptides. Pro-survival Signaling: Apelin is a highly conserved arginine-rich peptide first identified in 1998 following its isolation in bovine stomach extracts. The peptide is expressed as a 77 amino acid preprotein, which can be processed into at least three bioactive carboxy-terminal fragments including apelin-36, apelin-17, and apelin-13 (Table 3). All apelin peptides can bind the G-protein coupled apelin receptor (originally named APJ) and induce cell signaling (332), with positively charged arginine and lysine resides in apelin, and negatively charged aspartate and glutamate resides in the extracellular N-terminal region of the apelin receptor important for receptor binding and internalization (333, 334). Apelin peptides and the apelin receptor are widely expressed throughout the body including brain, heart, adipose, skeletal muscle, kidney, and lung. The apelin/apelin receptor system regulates cardiac and vascular function, glucose metabolism, fluid homeostasis, cell survival, and angiogenesis. Other CARPs including poly-arginine peptide R9D and protamine can bind to the apelin receptor (333, 335). Interestingly, pre-treatment of cells with R9D and protamine appears to inhibit subsequent apelin receptor signaling. However, this is likely due to the R9D and protamine peptides desensitizing the receptor or inducing receptor internalization because pre-treatment of cells with apelin peptides also decreases apelin receptor cell signaling (336). The apelin receptor can dimerise with the κ-opioid G-protein-coupled receptor (KOR) and bind both apelin and dynorphin A peptides (Table 3) and activate extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling (337). Pro-survival Signaling: Established signaling events activated by the apelin receptor are the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), ERK1/2 and phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathways (338–340). The AMPK pathway is a major energy sensing system that monitors for low levels of energy molecules, such as ATP and AMP to induce cellular adaptive metabolic changes to preserve and better utilize remaining energy substrates and maintain mitochondrial function. In addition, AMPK can activate the transcription factor Nrf2, resulting in the expression of anti-oxidant proteins. The ERK pathway has diverse actions including cell survival mediated by the expression of pro-survival proteins (e.g., BCL2) and inhibition of pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., BAD). Similarly, the PI3K/AKT pathway promotes cell survival by targeting and phosphorylating proteins that regulate cell death and survival, cell migration and metabolism and angiogenesis. Pro-survival Signaling: With respect to neuroprotection, apelin peptides reduce intracellular calcium influx and neuronal death following NMDA receptor mediated excitotoxicity (163–166, 341), and improve outcomes in animal stroke, perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage and Alzheimer's disease models (see Table 3). The neuroprotective mechanism of action of apelin peptides have been attributed to AMPK, ERK, and/or AKT mediated signaling by inhibiting apoptosis, suppressing inflammation, reducing ER stress, preserving BBB integrity and stimulating angiogenesis (163, 166–170, 340–342), as well as mechanisms independent of apelin receptor signaling (164, 165). Pro-survival Signaling: The endogenous CARP toddler (also known as elabela/apela; QRPVNLTMRRKLRKHNCLQRRCMPLHSRVPFP; net charge +9.1) can also bind the apelin receptor and induce ERK signaling (343). Whereas, an anti-microbial CARP SR-0379 (MLKLIFLHRLKRMRKRLKRK; net charge +11) can stimulate ERK and AKT phosphorylation in dermal fibroblasts via a cell surface integrin receptor (344). In addition, the anti-microbial LL-37 peptide can bind to cell surface receptors in different cells, and activate downstream ERK, AKT, or P38 signaling (345, 346). Finally, protamine and polycationic arginine and lysine peptides interact with and enhance the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity and thereby enhance cell signaling activated by the receptor (347, 348). Inhibiting Protein Aggregation in Neurodegenerative Disorders: Protein misfolding can lead to protein aggregation, and the accumulation of specific protein oligomers, aggregates and fibrils is the hallmark of several chronic neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (e.g., Aβ peptide, tau), Parkinson's disease (e.g., α-synuclein), Huntington's disease (e.g., Huntingtin), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (e.g., SOD1). Arginine is a common additive to protein solutions to facilitate protein folding, and to help maintain protein stability and inhibit protein aggregation (349, 350). Since arginine can stabilize proteins and inhibit self-aggregation, it is possible CARPs can also reduce protein misfolding and aggregation, and is a mechanism through which CARPs may be beneficial in animal models of human neurodegenerative disorders associated with proteinopathies. Inhibiting Protein Aggregation in Neurodegenerative Disorders: The guanidinium head group of arginine and the ability of arginine to self-associate to form clusters (n-mers; n > 2) is considered a critical mechanism responsible for suppressing protein aggregation (349). Arginine clusters associate with the surface of proteins, namely aromatic (e.g., tryptophan) and negatively charged (e.g., glutamate) amino acid residues via cation-π interactions and hydrogen bonding, respectively. The interaction of arginine clusters with hydrophobic residues not normally exposed in the native state stabilizes partially unfolded proteins and act to “crowd around” proteins to prevent aggregation (350). Hence, it is conceivable that CARPs, such as poly-arginine molecules due to their multivalent arginine arrangement behave in a similar fashion to arginine clusters to prevent protein aggregation. For example, CARPs that inhibit Aβ oligomer formation, which is considered neurotoxic include KLVFFRRRRRR (net charge +7) and R5 (RRRRRR: net charge +5) (351), 15M (Ac-VITNPNRRNRTPQMLKR-NH2: net charge +5) (352) SRPGLRR (net charge +3) (353), RR-7-animo-4-trifluromethylcoumarin (net charge +3) (354) RI-OR2-TAT (Ac-rGffvlkGrrrrkkrGy-NH2: charge +9) (355) R8-Aβ (25–35) (rrrrrrrr-gsnkgaiiglm: net charge +10) (356), and the related D3 and RD2 peptides (Table 1) (28, 29). In a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, R9 administered subcutaneously over 4 weeks, decreased brain Aβ deposits by 15%, albeit the reduction was not statistically significant (357). In addition, poly-arginine (5–15 kDa; 32–96-mers) can inhibit the aggregation of a tau mutant protein (P301L) commonly associated with tauopathy (358), and the CARPs P42-TAT (Table 2) (118) and TAT-P110 (Table 2) (149) inhibit aggregation of mutant Huntingtin protein. Interestingly, several of the key proteins that accumulate in the CNS in chronic neurodegenerative disorders are negatively-charged (e.g., Aβ 1–42: −2.7; tau: −6.2; α-synuclein: −8.9; Huntington: −59.7; SOD1: −5.5), which would increase their electrostatic affinity to positively-charged molecules, and make them ideal therapeutic targets for CARPs.\n"

        "abstract": "There are virtually no clinically available neuroprotective drugs for the treatment of acute and chronic neurological disorders, hence there is an urgent need for the development of new neuroprotective molecules. Cationic arginine-rich peptides (CARPs) are an expanding and relatively novel class of compounds, which possess intrinsic neuroprotective properties. Intriguingly, CARPs possess a combination of biological properties unprecedented for a neuroprotective agent including the ability to traverse cell membranes and enter the CNS, antagonize calcium influx, target mitochondria, stabilize proteins, inhibit proteolytic enzymes, induce pro-survival signaling, scavenge toxic molecules, and reduce oxidative stress as well as, having a range of anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-microbial, and anti-cancer actions. CARPs have also been used as carrier molecules for the delivery of other putative neuroprotective agents across the blood-brain barrier and blood-spinal cord barrier. However, there is increasing evidence that the neuroprotective efficacy of many, if not all these other agents delivered using a cationic arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide (CCPPs) carrier (e.g., TAT) may actually be mediated largely by the properties of the carrier molecule, with overall efficacy further enhanced according to the amino acid composition of the cargo peptide, in particular its arginine content. Therefore, in reviewing the neuroprotective mechanisms of action of CARPs we also consider studies using CCPPs fused to a putative neuroprotective peptide. We review the history of CARPs in neuroprotection and discuss in detail the intrinsic biological properties that may contribute to their cytoprotective effects and their usefulness as a broad-acting class of neuroprotective drugs.",

            "Introduction": "Human and animal cathelicidins comprise one of the largest and most well-studied classes of antimicrobial host defense peptides (HDPs) in higher vertebrates [1]. Cathelicidins represent not only the front line of host defense against infection but are also involved in innate and acquired immunity [2]. Cathelicidin genes have been studied in many mammalian species, including humans, cows, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, rabbits, mice, guinea pigs, and others [3]. A number of species have multiple cathelicidin genes encoding different peptides [4,5], but humans and mice contain a single functional cathelicidin gene in each genome. The only human cathelicidin LL-37 sequence begins with two leucine amino acid residues and is composed of 37 a.a. residues, giving the abbreviation LL-37 to this peptide. It is found in secretory granules of neutrophils in its 18-kDa inactive prepropeptide form designated as hCAP-18, which includes the C-terminal cationic antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin LL-37 and the neutralizing N-terminal pro-domain, consisting of the signal peptide (30 a.a.) and the highly conserved pro-sequence (103 a.a.) called the cathelin-like domain [4,6]. Degranulation and release of hCAP-18 occur via stimulation by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After the peptide release, endoproteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal cathelicidin LL-37 activates the peptide. In addition to constitutive expression in neutrophils, hCAP-18 is also secreted by different cell types, such as keratinocytes, epithelial cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, lymphocytes, mesenchymal stem cells, and bone marrow stroma [7]. LL-37 is believed to play an important role in epithelial immunity under pathogen infection, especially in airway epithelium and intestinal mucosal surfaces [8,9]. For instance, LL-37/hCAP-18 was shown to be expressed in epithelial cells of the upper crypts of the normal human colon in vivo [10]. LL-37 is able to increase the expression of epithelial tight junction proteins (claudin-1, occluding, ZO-1, and ZO-2), which are known to be associated with intestinal barrier function [10]. LL-37 demonstrates a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities against Gram(+) and Gram(−) bacteria, including S. aureus, M. tuberculosis, and L. monocytogenes; viruses such as herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and adenovirus; fungi such as C. albicans; and some parasitic protozoans such as Leishmania sp. [11]. Apart from a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities, LL-37 has potent immunomodulatory properties. For instance, LL-37 was shown to be involved in the induction of both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in the immune system. Pro-inflammatory responses are usually linked with the stimulation of chemotaxis (via recruiting and activating neutrophils), immune cell differentiation, and the induction of adaptive immunity responses, whereas anti-inflammatory responses are implemented through the inhibition of cytokine release and direct scavenging of bacterial endotoxins [7,12]. It has been shown that in in vitro experiments, the human cathelicidin, LL-37, was able to induce the production of various cytokines and chemokines by different human cell types. For instance, LL-37 has been shown to induce the production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNFα by macrophages and monocytes, the inflammatory IL-36 by keratinocytes, upregulate anti-inflammatory receptors such as TGF-βR, and stimulate the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by macrophages [13]. However, it remains an open question whether such induction of cytokine production occurs in vivo, or, in other words, if this immunomodulatory action of LL-37 is biologically relevant, as most of the experiments were conducted using LL-37 at concentrations that were much higher (>20 μg/mL), than those of LL-37 in non-inflamed tissues (1–5 μg/mL). LL-37 has been studied in a number of clinical trials on humans [14,15]. It has been anticipated that research interest in the therapeutic potential of LL-37 will continue to expand, and there might be new discoveries in the near future [16]. However, there is still a lack of data regarding the absorption of LL-37 in the gut in vivo or its permeability through the gastrointestinal barrier in vitro. The aim of this study is to assess the in vitro permeability potential of human cathelicidin LL-37 across the Caco-2 polarized monolayer to roughly estimate its absorption properties in the human intestine and also to study the immunomodulatory properties of LL-37 at low physiological concentrations (up to 5 μg/mL) on different human cell cultures in the presence of an epithelial barrier in order to evaluate a possible role of LL-37 in epithelial immunity.",
            "Materials and Methods": "2.1. Materials: LL-37 (M.w. 4493) (of >98% purity) was produced using standard solid-phase peptide synthesis. This peptide was kindly provided by Dr. Maxim N. Zhmak and subsequently purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a semi-preparative reversed-phase column, ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ, 5-μm particle size, pore size 120 A, 10 × 250 mm (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany). RP-HPLC was performed at a flow rate of 2 mL/min in a linear gradient from 5 to 80% (v/v) of acetonitrile in water with the addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for 60 min. 2.2.1. Growing of Caco-2 Epithelial Barriers: Caco-2 cell line (ATCC HTB-37) was cultured in a humidified CO2-incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C) in the complete DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and 1X antibiotic–antimycotic solution (Gibco). To stabilize the cell phenotype, Caco-2 cells have been subcultivated three times before seeding on the filter supports. Then, Caco-2 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/cm2 onto 24-well Millicell cell culture inserts (PC, 0.4-μm pore size, 0.6 cm2 surface area, cat. #PIHP01250) (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), precoated with 0.2% bovine gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). After seeding, Caco-2 cells were grown in the same complete medium with re-feeding every 2–3 days until polarization of the monolayer occurred. The functional polarity of the monolayers was developed when transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) between the apical and basolateral surfaces of the monolayers reached 400 Ω/cm2 as measured by the electrical resistance system Millicell-ERS Voltohmmeter (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). Grown cell monolayers were used in transport and cytokine production experiments between the 21st and 29th days. 2.2.2. Generation of Mature Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cells (moDCs): Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a healthy donor were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC PCS-800-011). Blood monocytes were isolated from PBMCs by plastic adhesion [17]. Mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) were generated in vitro from peripheral blood monocytes, according to Nair et al. [18]. Briefly, monocytes were cultured in a humidified CO2-incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C) in the complete RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco) with 10% FBS, antibiotics, and supplemented with a cytokine cocktail containing 500 U/mL rhIL-4 and 800 U/mL rhGM-CSF (both Sci-Store, Moscow, Russia). On the third day, the medium was replaced by the same fresh medium with FBS, antibiotics, and the cytokine cocktail. Induction of maturation of the immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells was performed on the 5th day by replacing the medium with the complete RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco) with 10% FBS and antibiotics, supplemented with a cytokine cocktail containing 500 U/mL rhIL-4, 800 U/mL rhGM-CSF (both Sci-Store, Moscow, Russia), and 100 U/mL rhTNF-α (Sigma-Aldrich), and subjected to subsequent incubation of the culture for 4 more days.  2.2.3. Isolation of NKT Cells: NKT cells (CD3+CD56+) were isolated from PBMCs using the FACSVantageDiVa cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), equipped with 405, 488, and 643 nm lasers (Supporting Materials, Figure S1). PBMCs were re-suspended in the FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA) and labeled with monoclonal mouse anti-human CD3-APC (clone UCHT1, Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA, USA) and mouse anti-human CD56-PE/Cy7 (clone N901, Beckman Coulter) antibodies to isolate NKT cells (CD3+CD56+).  2.2.3. Isolation of NKT Cells: Sorted NKT cells were expanded by stimulation with Dynabead Human T-Expander CD3/CD28 magnetic beads (Gibco) in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 1X antibiotic–antimycotic solution, 100 U/mL IL-2 (Gibco), and 50 ng/mL IL-7 (Sci-Store). CD3/CD28 magnetic beads were subsequently removed with a magnet. Expanded NKT cells were washed out of the cytokines and cryopreserved. 2.3. Labeling of LL-37 with Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC): LL-37 was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I (FITC) (Sigma-Aldrich). For coupling with FITC, 0.5 mg of LL-37 in 50 μL of DMSO was first mixed with 200 μL of the carbonate–bicarbonate coupling buffer (0.1 M sodium carbonate, 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 10.4). Then, 4 mg of FITC in 200 μL of DMSO was added to the solution, and the resultant mixture was incubated in the dark at room temperature (20–22 °C) for 2 h. FITC-LL-37 was purified by using a PD10 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) pre-equilibrated with PBS. 2.4. Transport of FITC-LL-37 through the Caco-2 Epithelial Monolayer: The penetration capability of FITC-LL-37 was investigated using Caco-2 cells as an in vitro model of the intestinal epithelial barrier, grown on permeable Millicell cell culture inserts. Transport of the compound from both sides of the monolayer was determined in the transport buffer (Hank’s balanced salt solution, containing 25 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM D(+)glucose, pH 7.4). To study the transport in the “apical-to-basolateral” (A → B) direction, 0.7 mL of the transport buffer (pH 7.4) was added to the wells of a 24-well plate, and 5 μM compound in the same transfer buffer was added to the apical chamber. At the same time, to study the transport in the “basolateral-to-apical” (B → A) direction, 0.4 mL of the transport buffer was added to the apical chamber, while 5 μM compound in 0.7 mL of the same transfer buffer was added to the wells of the 24-well plate from the basolateral (serosal) side of the monolayer. The transfer buffer and the donor solution (5 μM of LL-37 in the transfer buffer) were pre-heated to 37 °C immediately prior to the experiment. Transport of LL-37 through Caco-2 polarized monolayers was conducted for 90 min in 4 independent inserts for each direction. 2.4. Transport of FITC-LL-37 through the Caco-2 Epithelial Monolayer: Transfer of LL-37 through Caco-2 monolayers under steady-state conditions was evaluated mathematically for each direction and each insert by the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp), calculated according to the following Equation (1): P\nwhere ΔC/Δt is the solute flux (nM/s) across the barrier, V is the volume of the acceptor chamber, A is the effective filter area of the well (cm2), and Ci is the initial concentration of the donor solution (nM). Analysis of the bidirectional “apical-to-basolateral” (A → B) and “basolateral-to-apical” (B → A) transport also included calculation of uptake (UR) and efflux (ER) ratios according to the following Equations (2) and (3):UR = P\nER = P 2.4. Transport of FITC-LL-37 through the Caco-2 Epithelial Monolayer: The integrity of the monolayers was checked by measuring TEER at the beginning and after the end of the transport experiment. 2.5. Stimulation of Human Cell Cultures with LL-37: Primary blood monocytes, moDCs, and NKT cells were seeded in 600 μL of complete RPMI-1640 with 10% Human AB serum (Capricorn Scientific, Ebsdorfergrund, Germany) and supplemented with 1X antibiotic–antimycotic solution into the wells of 24-well plates at a density of 3–7 × 105 cells/well 24 h before the experiment. Then, 24 h later, the medium in each well was replaced by the same medium with 1 μM of LL-37 for the sample wells or fresh medium alone for the control wells, and the permeable inserts with the Caco-2 monolayer with TEER > 400 Ω × cm2, containing 400 μL of the complete medium in their apical chamber, were immediately placed into the appropriate wells. Also, inserts with the Caco-2 monolayer were placed in cell-free wells of 24-well plates in the same complete RPMI-1640 medium with or without 1 μM of LL-37 as controls. Cells were kept in a CO2-incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C) for another 24 h. Then, culture medium from each well was collected, centrifuged, and frozen at −70 °C. 2.6. Multiplex Assay to Quantitatively Evaluate Cytokines, Chemokines, and Growth Factor Levels in Culture Supernatants: To quantitatively evaluate a broad spectrum of analytes secreted by human cell cultures at the protein level, multiplex xMAP technology was used. The chosen panel (cat. #HCYTA-60K-PX48, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) included 48 different magnetic beads with primary antibodies to the following cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors: CCL11 (Eotaxin-1), Flt-3 ligand, CX3CL1 (Fractalkine), sCD40L, FGF-2, EGF, GROα, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-1RA, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, CXCL8 (IL-8), IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A (CTLA8), IL-17E (IL-25), IL-17F, IL-18, IL-22, IL-27, IFNγ, IFNα2, CXCL10 (IP-10), CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL7 (MCP-3), CCL22 (MDC), CXCL9 (MIG), CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β), CCL5 (RANTES), M-CSF, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB, TNFα, TNFβ, TGFα, and VEGF-A. The assay was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions with overnight incubation of the samples with primary antibodies, and the plate was read on a MAGPIX System (Merck) using the xPONENT 4.2 software (Merck). The acquired fluorescence data were analyzed by the MILLIPLEX Analyst v5.1 software (Merck), which realized an advanced curve-fitting algorithm. Levels of the analytes in control and experimental samples were compared with an unpaired two-sample t-test using GraphPad Prism v.8.0.1 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The p-values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. 2.7. Analysis of Cell Signaling Pathways: Primary blood monocytes were isolated from PBMCs by plastic adhesion in the wells of a 24-well plate 24 h prior to the experiment. For that, 2 × 106 PBMC were seeded in each well in 2 mL of RPMI-1640 without supplements and kept for 1 h in a humidified CO2-incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C). Then, the adhered monocytes were thoroughly washed 3 times with the culture medium without supplements, and 600 μL of the complete RPMI-1640, supplemented with 10% Human AB serum, was added into each well. Then, 24 h later, the medium in the wells of a 24-well plate was replaced by a fresh medium with or without 1 μM of LL-37, and the permeable inserts with Caco-2 monolayers with TEER > 400 Ω × cm2, containing 400 μL of the complete medium in their apical chamber, were immediately placed into the appropriate wells for 2 h. Then, 2 h later, the culture medium and the inserts were carefully removed, and the cells in each well were washed with PBS and lysed in 100 μL of MILLIPLEX MAP Lysis Buffer (cat. #43-040, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), containing phosphatase inhibitors including 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4). To prevent protein degradation, a protease inhibitor cocktail (cat. #535140, Merck) was freshly added to the MILLIPLEX MAP Lysis Buffer. Cell lysate preparation was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. 2.7. Analysis of Cell Signaling Pathways: The phosphorylation of the following key cell signaling kinases and transcription factors was measured in cell lysates by using the MILLIPLEX multi-pathway magnetic bead 9-plex kit (#48-680MAG, Merck), containing phosphorylation state-specific antibodies: ERK/MAP kinase 1/2 (Thr185/Tyr187), Akt (Ser473), STAT3 (Ser727), JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), p70S6 kinase (Thr412), NF-κB (Ser536), STAT5A/B (Tyr694/699), CREB (Ser133), and p38 (Thr180/Tyr182). β-Tubulin MAPmate magnetic beads (#46-713MAG, Merck) were used as an assay normalization control to normalize the total protein level between the samples. A multiplex assay was carried out in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions with overnight incubation of the samples with primary antibodies to phosphorylated signaling proteins on the MAGPIX system (Merck) using the xPONENT 4.2 software (Merck). The final analysis of the acquired fluorescence data was performed with the MILLIPLEX Analyst v5.1 software (Merck). Normalized MFI values were compared with an unpaired two-sample t-test using GraphPad Prism v.8.0.1 (GraphPad Software). The p-values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant.",
            "Results": "3.1. The Human Host Defense Peptide LL-37 Is Able to Pass across the Intestinal-Like Caco-2 Epithelial Barrier: Human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells are known to be able to form monolayers with a differentiated phenotype, implementing a number of functions proper to the small intestinal villus epithelium. Therefore, polarized monolayers of Caco-2 cells grown on permeable inserts have become the gold standard for in vitro assessment of intestinal drug permeability and absorption [19]. Here, we used the FITC-labeled human cathelicidin LL-37 for an assessment of bidirectional (A → B, absorptive, and B → A, secretory) transport of the host defense peptide through the Caco-2 polarized monolayer. Apparent permeability (Papp) coefficients in absorptive direction (A → B) for LL-37 were within the range of 0.9–1.0 × 10−6 cm/s (Figure 1), which predicted a low absorption of LL-37 in the human gut (0–20%) [20]. 3.1. The Human Host Defense Peptide LL-37 Is Able to Pass across the Intestinal-Like Caco-2 Epithelial Barrier: A higher Papp in the secretory (B → A) direction was observed: 1.7–2.1 × 10−6 cm/s for B → A versus 0.9–1.0 × 10−6 cm/s for A → B. The uptake (UR) and efflux ratios (ER) were also calculated and shown to be 0.51 and 1.95, respectively. An efflux ratio < 2 is usually considered to indicate the absence of active efflux [21]. 3.2. The Human Cathelicidin LL-37 Induced Production of IL-8/CXCL8, IL-22, and TNF-β by Caco-2 Cells: In the current study, 48 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were assessed in the cell culture media at the protein level by the multiplex xMAP technology (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX, USA). This technology is based on the simultaneous use of different types of magnetic microspheres. Each type of such microsphere is conjugated with a capture antibody that binds and retains a particular analyte from the sample [22]. Subsequent incubation of the microspheres with detection antibodies and streptavidin–phycoerythrin conjugate is similar to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Thus, the principle of the multiplex xMAP technology is the same as in the ELISA assay except that capture antibodies are conjugated with magnetic microspheres but not coated on polystyrene surfaces. This approach allows the simultaneous evaluation of a wide range of analytes in each sample. 3.2. The Human Cathelicidin LL-37 Induced Production of IL-8/CXCL8, IL-22, and TNF-β by Caco-2 Cells: To assess cytokines produced by Caco-2 cells, stimulation with 1 μM LL-37 of the Caco-2 epithelial barrier, grown on a permeable insert with TEER > 400 Ω × cm2, was studied. It was shown that LL-37 was able to stimulate the production of IL-8/CXCL8 in Caco-2 cells. Levels of IL-8/CXCL8 were increased from 28 to 86 pg/mL; however, due to a wide range between replications, this elevation failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.16). Nevertheless, it has been previously shown that LL-37 was able to induce the production of IL-8/CXCL8 by epithelial cells, which stimulated neutrophil migration [13]. Interestingly, NKT cells can inhibit the production of IL-8/CXCL8 by epithelial cells (Figure 2). We found that 1μM LL-37 was able to induce a slight but statistically significant elevation of IL-22 and TNF-β levels in the Caco-2 culture media after 24 h of incubation. Thus, LL-37 induced an elevation of IL-22 levels from 27 to 39 pg/mL (p = 0.013) in the Caco-2 culture alone. At the same time, LL-37 did not induce any changes in the IL-22 level in the monocyte culture alone (Figure 2). An elevation of IL-22 levels from 48 to 71 pg/mL (p = 0.029) in the Caco-2/monocytes co-culture was observed (Figure 2). LL-37 also did not induce any changes in the production of IL-22 by moDCs and NKT cells; however, we observed an elevation of IL-22 levels from 26 to 37 pg/mL (p = 0.10) and from 27 to 34 pg/mL (p = 0.093) in cases of Caco-2/moDCs and Caco-2/NKT cell co-cultures, respectively (Supporting Materials, Table S1). Similarly, LL-37 induced an elevation of TNF-β levels from 12.9 to 18.9 pg/mL (p = 0.02) in the Caco-2 culture alone. No changes in TNF-β levels were observed in the monocyte culture alone, while an elevation of TNF-β levels from 21.6 to 30.5 pg/mL (p = 0.015) was observed (Figure 2). No changes in TNF-β production in response to stimulation of moDCs and NKT with LL-37 were observed; however, a slight elevation of TNF-β levels was detected in cases of Caco-2/moDCs and Caco-2/NKT cell co-cultures (Supporting Materials, Table S1). 3.2. The Human Cathelicidin LL-37 Induced Production of IL-8/CXCL8, IL-22, and TNF-β by Caco-2 Cells: To the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time that LL-37 can increase the secretion of IL-22 and TNF-β by epithelial cells. It is known that IL-22 is a critical regulator of epithelial homeostasis. It has been shown to be implicated in multiple aspects of epithelial barrier function, including regulation of epithelial cell growth and permeability, production of mucus, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and complement [23]. TNF-β, known nowadays as lymphotoxin-α (LTα), has been shown to actively contribute to effector immune responses [24]. LTα regulates dendritic and CD4+ T cell homeostasis in the steady state and determines the functions of these cells during pathogenic challenges [24]. 3.3. Cathelicidin LL-37 Differently Activates Human Immune Cells in the Absence or Presence of the Caco-2 Epithelial Barrier: Experiments with stimulation of cell cultures were performed in 24-well plates with or without permeable inserts containing the Caco-2 epithelial monolayer. For each immune cell culture, stimulation with 1 μM LL-37 in the presence or absence of the Caco-2 monolayer was studied. Wells containing immune cells alone and ones with the Caco-2/immune cells co-culture, both without LL-37 were used as controls. 3.3. Cathelicidin LL-37 Differently Activates Human Immune Cells in the Absence or Presence of the Caco-2 Epithelial Barrier: It was shown that in some cases, the LL-37 action on immune cells did not depend on the presence of the Caco-2 epithelial monolayer. For instance, stimulation of blood monocytes with LL-37 induced elevation of MIP-1β/CCL4 levels from 78 to 2750 pg/mL (p = 0.0004) in the absence of Caco-2 cells and from 49 to above the detectable maximum of 3455 pg/mL (p = 0.017) in the presence of Caco-2 cells. Similarly, stimulation of moDCs with LL-37 induced inhibition of IL-10 levels from 89 to 62 pg/mL (p = 0.0058) in the absence of Caco-2 cells and from 81 to 52 pg/mL (p = 0.0035) in the presence of Caco-2 cells. In some cases, LL-37 induced a slight elevation of the analyte in the absence of Caco-2 cells and a strong elevation in the presence of Caco-2 cells. For example, stimulation of monocytes with LL-37 induced a slight elevation of G-CSF levels from 121 to 220 pg/mL (p = 0.002) in the absence of Caco-2 cells and a strong elevation from 181 to 1150 pg/mL (p = 0.012) in the presence of Caco-2 cells. Similarly, MIP-1α/CCL3 increased from 45 to 109 pg/mL (p = 0.0001) in the absence of Caco-2 cells and from 27 to 3622 pg/mL (p = 0.11) in the presence of Caco-2 cells, also in the monocyte culture. In some cases, LL-37 did not induce a statistically significant change in the analyte in the absence of Caco-2 cells but induced its elevation (with the exception of MDC/CCL22 in moDCs, where a decrease in its level was observed) in the presence of Caco-2 cells. For instance, there was a slight statistically insignificant increase in the IL-1β production by monocytes from 25 to 32 pg/mL (p = 0.094) in response to incubation with LL-37 in the absence of Caco-2 cells; however, a statistically significant increase in the IL-1β production from 29 to 104 pg/mL (p = 0.0072) was observed in the presence of Caco-2 cells (Figure 2). Similar results were obtained for TNFα: elevations of TNFα levels from 110 to 123 pg/mL (p = 0.15) for monocytes alone and from 87 to 306 pg/mL (p = 0.019) in the presence of Caco-2 cells were observed. The same effects were observed for IL-10: its production increased from 22.5 to 23.6 pg/mL (p = 0.23) for monocytes alone and from 14.8 to 57.4 pg/mL (p = 0.0007) in the presence of Caco-2 cells. Finally, in some cases, LL-37 induced inhibition of the analyte level in the absence of Caco-2 cells and its elevation in the presence of Caco-2 cells. For instance, stimulation of monocytes with LL-37 induced a decrease in MIG/CXCL9 levels from 606 to 342 pg/mL (p = 0.003) in the absence of Caco-2 cells and an increase from 306 to 959 pg/mL (p = 0.0018) in the presence of Caco-2 cells. The same was observed for IP-10/CXCL10 produced by monocytes and moDCs (Figure 2). 3.3. Cathelicidin LL-37 Differently Activates Human Immune Cells in the Absence or Presence of the Caco-2 Epithelial Barrier: To confirm the role of the epithelial monolayer in the activation of monocytes by stimulation with 1μM LL-37, the phosphorylation of a wide panel of kinases and other intracellular signaling intermediates, including CREB, ERK 1/2, JNK, NF-κB, p38, p70S6K, STAT3, STAT5, and Akt, was studied. It is known that changes in phosphorylation of MAPK can be detected within minutes after exposure to specific stimuli [25]. We chose a 2-hour exposure time to induce MAPK phosphorylation in monocytes and epithelial cells by LL-37 with subsequent production of soluble factors by both cell cultures, which would result in epithelial-dependent activation of monocytes through MAPK phosphorylation. After stimulation for 2 h, an increase in production of phosphorylated ERK 1/2 (Thr185/Tyr187), and p70S6 (Thr412) serine/threonine kinases was detected only in the case of Caco-2/monocytes+LL-37, but not in the cases of monocytes+LL-37 or Caco-2/monocytes (Figure 3; Supporting Materials, Table S2).",
            "Discussion": "The only human cathelicidin, LL-37, has a broad spectrum of biological activities. It is produced at mucosal surfaces by epithelial cells, up-regulated in response to infection and inflammation, and can be released by degranulation of neutrophils. LL-37 has been shown to be involved in human innate and acquired immunity. This host defense peptide displays in vitro antimicrobial activities against many pathogens, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, protozoans, and enveloped viruses. However, it has been shown to exhibit reduced bactericidal effects under physiological conditions due to the presence of salt and serum. This is why the key role of the direct antimicrobial activity of LL-37 in host defense against microbial infections in vivo is disputable today [26,27]. LL-37 is also involved in tissue repair and exhibits contradictory effects on tumor growth [16]. Moreover, LL-37 has been shown to bind to extracellular DNA and RNA and increase extracellular nucleotide uptake. It can also bind to pathogens and thereby opsonize them, as well as enhance phagocytosis of opsonized pathogens [13]. This peptide has also been shown to attract a variety of leukocytes, such as neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and CD4+ T-cells, as well as induce chemotaxis of granulocytes and mast cells. Despite some limitations, LL-37 is of interest with regard to its clinical applications. For example, phase I clinical trials (NCT02225366) with intra-tumoral injections of LL-37 for melanoma patients with cutaneous metastases have been completed and have shown a significant potency of LL-37 against this form of cancer. A phase IIb double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study has shown the effectiveness of LL-37 in the healing of hard-to-heal venous leg ulcers [14]. LL-37 has also been shown to be an effective antiviral drug in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 [15]. Under clinical study, patients with COVID-19 orally took a genetically modified probiotic, Lactococcus lactis, which secreted the target ~34 kDa protein, consisting of seven repeats of the mature human LL-37 alternating with enterokinase. Research interest in the therapeutic potential of LL-37 continues to expand, and there might be new findings in the near future [16]. At the same time, there is a lack of data about LL-37 absorption in the gut in vivo or its permeability through the gastrointestinal barrier in vitro. This is why the first step of the current study was to evaluate the ability of LL-37 to transfer across the Caco-2 monolayer. We demonstrated that LL-37 can permeate through the Caco-2 monolayer with a low efficiency (Papp = 0.9–1.0 × 10−6 cm/s), which may predict 0–20% absorption in the gut [20]. Our data indicate that drug delivery systems, for example, absorption enhancers, might be required for the intact LL-37 to increase its bioavailability in the case of oral administration. LL-37 is considered today as a potential drug with pronounced immunomodulatory activity. There are plenty of studies on LL-37’s immunomodulatory activities in vitro on different types of cells [28]. However, it still remains an open question whether immunomodulatory activities observed in vitro take place in vivo, or, in other words, whether the immunomodulatory effects of LL-37 are physiologically relevant. A major criticism of host defense peptide research is that antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects are observed in cell cultures at much higher concentrations than those expected to occur in vivo or observed only at sites of severe chronic inflammation [27]. It has been demonstrated that the average concentration of the human cathelicidin LL-37 was 1.18 μg/mL in the serum of healthy individuals, which was several folds higher than that for other neutrophil-specific granule proteins [29]. However, local concentrations of LL-37 upon neutrophil degranulation can be much higher [27]. LL-37 has been detected at concentrations of ∼5 μg/mL in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of healthy infants, and its concentration was increased by two- to threefold in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of infants with systemic or pulmonary inflammation [30]. In this regard, the chemotactic ability of LL-37 is not impaired by serum, and LL-37 is able to attract monocytes and mast cells and induce migration of epithelial cells at the low physiological concentration of 5 μg/mL [13]. At the same time, activation of granulocytes and stimulation of mast cell degranulation require a concentration of 10 μg/mL, while induction of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation takes place at a concentration of 25 μg/mL [31,32], which demands elevated levels of LL-37. In contrast to the chemotactic potential of LL-37, available data on its ability to induce cytokine production by different cells argue for the absence of its biological activity at low physiological concentrations of ∼5 μg/mL observed in non-inflamed tissues. Previously, it has been reported that LL-37 was not able to increase the production of TNFα or IL-10 in human PBMCs at a concentration of 5 μg/mL [33]. In the current study, we used LL-37 at a concentration of 1 μM (4.5 μg/mL) to study whether this peptide had immunomodulatory activity under non-inflamed physiological conditions. In our study, we did not observe upregulation of either TNFα or IL-10 upon direct stimulation of monocytes with 4.5 μg/mL LL-37, which is in accordance with previous data. However, we showed that LL-37 at this concentration was able to induce the production of both TNFα and IL-10 by monocytes in the presence of the Caco-2 epithelial barrier (Figure 2). Similar results have been obtained in the case of the main monocytic pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β. Previous data denoted that LL-37 could stimulate the production of IL-1β by monocytes only at concentrations of 10–20 μg/mL. These values fall within the LL-37 concentration range measured during inflammation [34], but not under non-inflamed physiological conditions. Our data neither showed significant upregulation of IL-1β upon direct stimulation of monocytes with 4.5 μg/mL LL-37. However, 4.5 μg/mL LL-37 was shown to be sufficient for activation of primary monocytes and secretion of IL-1β by them in the presence of the Caco-2 monolayer. This fact allowed us to assume that epithelial-immune cell crosstalk might have a predominant role in the biological action of LL-37 in vivo, making this peptide able to activate immune cells at lower concentrations while being close to epithelial barriers. This phenomenon was observed not only in the monocytic culture but also in other cultures of immune cells, such as NKT and dendritic cells. However, this effect on the latter cultures was less pronounced (Figure 2). To confirm our assumption, we decided to obtain one more piece of biological evidence at the cell signaling pathway level. Activation of signaling pathways only in the case of Caco-2/monocytes+LL-37, but not in the cases of monocytes+LL-37 or Caco-2/monocytes, may argue for epithelial-immune cells crosstalk-mediated cell activation by LL-37. For this experiment, the culture of primary monocytes was chosen, and a broad panel of kinases and other signaling intermediates, including CREB, ERK 1/2, JNK, NF-κB, p38, p70S6K, STAT3, STAT5, and Akt, was used. Consequently, 2 h after stimulation with 4.5 μg/mL of LL-37, we found in cell lysates a significant phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p70S6 kinase only in the case of Caco-2/monocytes+LL-37, but not in the cases of monocytes+LL-37 or Caco-2/monocytes (Figure 3; Supporting Materials, Table S2). Thus, the MAPK/ERK pathway (also known as the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) was activated in monocytes by 4.5 μg/mL LL-37 due to communication between epithelial cells and monocytes. Then, ERK1/2 kinase probably phosphorylates p70S6 kinase, whose substrate is the S6 ribosomal protein. Phosphorylation of S6 induces protein synthesis by ribosomes and is a rate-limiting step for translation. Previously, it has been shown that LL-37 could signal via the induction of phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK1/2 and p38 in peripheral blood-derived monocytes and in the human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell line [35]. It is important to note that the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 was observed only at high concentrations of LL-37 (25–50 μg/mL). However, in the presence of GM-CSF, activation of these kinases was shown to occur at lower concentrations of LL-37 (5–10 μg/mL) [35]. Thus, in the presence of a secondary signal such as GM-CSF (but not G-CSF), the threshold of the LL-37 concentration for displaying its immunomodulatory action may decrease. Our results (Figure 2, Supporting Table S1) and data obtained by Urdinguio et al. [36] indicated that the Caco-2 cell line is not a source of GM-CSF. We assumed that LL-37 induced the production of some molecular factors in the Caco-2/monocyte co-culture that acted as GM-CSF, decreasing the LL-37 concentration threshold required for the activation of monocytes. Interestingly, we did not observe phosphorylation of p38 in monocytes stimulated for 2 h in the absence or presence of LL-37 (Figure 3). In contrast to the p70S6 kinase, which can be a part of the MAPK/ERK pathway, p38 is a part of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway. The MAPK/ERK pathway is classically activated by growth factors and mitogens, while the p38-MAPK/SAPK pathway can also be activated by stress factors and inflammatory cytokines [37]. Apparently, LL-37 is able to activate both MAPK/ERK and p38-MAPK/SAPK pathways at high concentrations (25–50 μg/mL), while at low physiological concentrations (4.5 μg/mL), LL-37 can induce epithelial-dependent activation of the only MAPK/ERK pathway in blood monocytes.",
            "Conclusions": "In summary, we assessed the permeability of the human cathelicidin LL-37 across the Caco-2 polarized monolayer, which is a model of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Here, we showed that this peptide can permeate through the Caco-2 monolayer with a low efficiency (Papp = 0.9–1.0 × 10−6 cm/s), which predicts its low (0–20%) absorption in the gut. By using the Caco-2/immune cell co-culture, we demonstrated the crucial role of epithelial-immune cell crosstalk in exhibiting the immunomodulatory properties of the human cathelicidin LL-37, which might shed light on its biological action in vivo. For the first time, our data show that LL-37 can increase the secretion of IL-22 and TNF-β by epithelial cells. We also demonstrated that LL-37 at a low physiological concentration of 4.5 μg/mL is able to induce a strong production of only MIP-1β/CCL4, but cannot fully activate monocytes. However, at the same concentration, LL-37 can fully activate monocytes in the Caco-2/immune cells co-culture model, inducing intracellular phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p70S6 serine/threonine kinases, as well as the production of cytokines IL-1, IL-10, IL-27, TNFα, chemokines MIP-1, MIG, IP-10, RANTES, and growth factors G-CSF, GM-CSF, and M-CSF. Our study suggests the existence of some molecular factors produced by stimulated epithelial cells that probably activate the same MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in monocytes, thus decreasing the LL-37 concentration threshold for the activation of monocytes. We also demonstrated similar effects at the cytokine production level on other cell cultures, such as monocyte-derived dendritic (moDCs) and NKT cells; however, in other cell cultures this effect was less pronounced. These findings indicate that the human cathelicidin LL-37 is able to fulfill its immunomodulatory action in vivo at low physiological concentrations of <5 μg/mL in the presence of epithelial barriers, at least near the intestinal epithelium."

        "abstract": "The only human cathelicidin, LL-37, is a host defense antimicrobial peptide with antimicrobial activities against protozoans, fungi, Gram(+) and Gram(-) bacteria, and enveloped viruses. It has been shown in experiments in vitro that LL-37 is able to induce the production of various inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by different human cell types. However, it remains an open question whether such cytokine induction is physiologically relevant, as LL-37 exhibited its immunomodulatory properties at concentrations that are much higher (>20 μg/mL) than those observed in non-inflamed tissues (1-5 μg/mL). In the current study, we assessed the permeability of LL-37 across the Caco-2 polarized monolayer and showed that this peptide could pass through the Caco-2 monolayer with low efficiency, which predetermined its low absorption in the gut. We showed that LL-37 at low physiological concentrations (<5 μg/mL) was not able to directly activate monocytes. However, in the presence of polarized epithelial monolayers, LL-37 is able to activate monocytes through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and induce the production of cytokines, as assessed by a multiplex assay at the protein level. We have demonstrated that LL-37 is able to fulfill its immunomodulatory action in vivo in non-inflamed tissues at low physiological concentrations. In the present work, we revealed a key role of epithelial-immune cell crosstalk in the implementation of immunomodulatory functions of the human cathelicidin LL-37, which might shed light on its physiological action in vivo.",

            "INTRODUCTION": "As one of the most studied central nervous system demyelinating and autoimmune degeneration diseases, MS still maintains increasing prevalence and poor prognosis.\n From 2013 to 2020, the prevalence of MS has risen 14.69% to 43.95 per 100,000 individuals globally.\n Although many disease‐modifying therapies have been developed, new therapies are still in need. Experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE)\n is a classical animal model mimicking central nervous demyelinating lesions and T‐cell responses of MS, offering convenient chances to test potential drugs for MS. Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) is a kind of endogenous incretin, first discovered in the early 1980s, produced from both gut and brain and exerts its role by binding to GLP‐1R, a G protein‐coupled receptor, then activating its downstream signal transduction cascades. In the digestive system, GLP‐1 is secreted from intestinal L cells by the stimulation of food intake and enhances insulin secretion from pancreatic islets, thus exerting its glucose‐dependent hypoglycemic effect, while in the nerve system, GLP‐1 is mainly secreted by preproglucagon‐expressing neurons from the nucleus tractus solitarius and can act as neurotransmitters, then regulate the activity of vagal nerve system and limbic nerve system to affect varieties of biological processes including eating behavior, weight control, emotions, energy metabolism homeostasis, cognitive abilities, and cardiovascular functions.\n, \n It has been reported that GLP‐1R exists in neurons and microglia and is widely distributed in the brain and spinal cord, especially expressed in cognitive‐related areas such as the hippocampus, giving GLP‐1 the potential for its neuroprotective effects.\n, \n, \n, \n However, endogenous GLP‐1 will be quickly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DDP‐4) after release to the extracellular space,\n so the pharmacological usage of which is limited. In the 1990s, after the discovery of long half‐life DPP‐4 resistant human GLP‐1 analog exendin‐4 from the venom of Heloderma lizard, many long‐acting GLP‐1R agonists were developed based on exendin‐4 structure and approved clinically for its hypoglycemic or bodyweight lowering usage.\n Among them, Lira is synthesized by Novo Nordisk with Lys34Arg amino acid substitution to enhance the resistance for DDP‐4 degradation and fatty acid side chains to reduce renal filtration\n and was the second‐licensed GLP‐1R agonist by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2010 for type 2 diabetes treatment. Moreover, during 10 years of GLP‐1R activating therapies, the neuroprotective therapeutic efficacy of Lira and other GLP‐1R agonists has been revealed and yielded widespread attention. Not only clinical trials but also animal experiments indicate GLP‐1R agonists could improve neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease\n, \n and Alzheimer's disease,\n, \n while GLP‐1R also exerts therapeutic efficacy on brain ischemia,\n, \n traumatic brain injury,\n and psychiatric disorders\n, \n, \n in animal models. Besides, various kinds of DPP‐4 inhibitors, which can increase the level of endogenous GLP‐1 level, exhibit neuroprotective and cognitive protective effects either.\n, \n, \n\n GLP‐1R agonists also play a role in neuroimmune processes. In terms of MS, GLP‐1R agonists and DPP‐4 inhibitors have been reported to have therapeutic efficacy on neuroinflammation and demyelination on EAE model,\n, \n cuprizone model\n in vivo, and BV2 model\n in vitro through regulating peripheral T helper (Th) cell proportions, stabilize microglia, and reduce pro‐inflammatory cytokines. Although it is demonstrated that Lira has a therapeutic effect on the Lewi rat EAE model, delayed its disease onset, and increased nerve tissue antioxidant capacity,\n the effect of Lira on mice EAE model and its underlying mechanisms have not been investigated. When GLP‐1R is activated by agonists, the G protein dissociates subsequently, activates adenylate cyclase and then generates cyclic adenosine monophosphate to trigger acute cell response. Meanwhile, activated G protein will stimulate a broad range of downstream molecules such as phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), and mitogen associated protein kinase to cause long‐term biological effects, including facilitation of insulin signaling, neurotrophy, anti‐oxidative and anti‐inflammation roles.\n, \n Recently, it has been demonstrated that Lira exerts therapeutic roles through AMPK, autophagy, and NLRP3 inflammasome in various kinds of animal or cell disease models.\n, \n, \n, \n, \n AMPK is a major sensor of cell metabolic status and is closely related to inflammation regulation.\n Phosphorylation of AMPK is related to the disease severity and treatment outcome in EAE models.\n, \n Autophagy, which is a lysosome‐dependent degradation pathway to clear potential cell toxic molecules and organelles, is in close relationship with MS pathogenesis.\n Impaired autophagy influx in nerve tissue may worsen EAE,\n and restoring autophagy levels in nerve tissue may have therapeutic effects on EAE.\n Similarly, NLRP3 inflammasome is a potent inflammatory signals sensor and involved in the pathogenesis of MS and EAE,\n which can recruit PYD and CARD domain‐containing (ASC), then activates caspase 1, then splices substrates including interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), interleukin 18 (IL‐18), and Gasdermin D (GSDMD), and even in some situation causes pyroptosis, a newly discovered programmed cell death, which leads to cell perforation and a large amount of pro‐inflammatory cytokines release, thus may exacerbate MS/EAE.\n\n In our research, to the best of our knowledge, we tested the anti‐inflammation and anti‐demyelination effect of Lira on mice EAE model for the first time; then, we tested whether Lira intervention could salvage the microglia from pyroptosis in vitro, therefore to expand the data for pharmacological effects of Lira on demyelinating disease.",
            "MATERIALS AND METHODS": "Materials and methods can be found in Appendix S1, Tables S1 and S2.",
            "RESULTS": "Lira ameliorated the disease score and delayed the disease onset of EAE mice: After 6 batches of experiments in search for the optimal and safe dosage of Lira for EAE mice, mice equivalent dosages of Lira for its clinically used human dosage (HD) exerting hyperglycemia effect were found to cause large numbers of unexpected death in EAE mice but not in healthy control (Ctrl) mice (Appendix S2, Figures [Link], [Link], Tables S3–S4). The dosage of 10 μg/kg.d (mice equivalent dosage for 1/10 of the minimum clinically used HD for its hypoglycemic activity) one time in 2 days (qod) starting from 8 days postimmunisation (dpi) was finally decided for observing its anti‐inflammation and anti‐demyelination therapeutic effect, which showed slightly improved disease score and accumulated disease score compared with EAE group after disease onset (Figure 1A,B). Moreover, disease onset was delayed by Lira administration (EAE versus EAE + Lira 14.31 ± 2.51 dpi versus 17.44 ± 4.13 dpi, p = 0.031) (Figure 1C). Liraglutide (Lira) administration ameliorated the disease score of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) mice and delayed the disease onset. EAE induction could reduce random blood glucose level, while Lira administration did not have an extra hypoglycemic activity. Certain dosages of Lira had insulin lowering effect compared with EAE group. Lira was administered subcutaneously (i.c.) daily (qd) or one time in 2 days (qod) after certain time points days postimmunisation (dpi). Data were shown in the form of mean ± SEM. * represents p < 0.05, ** represents p < 0.01, *** represents p < 0.001. (A–C) shows disease score, accumulated disease score and disease onset of EAE + Lira group and EAE group, n = 13–28 per group. The rating scale is 1 (paralyzed tail); 2 (posterior limb paresis); 3 (posterior limb paraplegia); 4 (posterior limb paraplegia with forelimb weakness or paralysis); 5 (moribund, or dead). Mice judged between grades received intermediate scores (±0.5). (D) shows random blood glucose level among different groups in serial time points, n = 5–15 per group. (E) shows random blood insulin level when mice were sacrificed, n = 5–10 per group. In addition, two unexpected died mice after Lira administration were tested EAE versus Lira in blood glucose and insulin levels: Random blood glucose was monitored every 3–4 days after immunization with the dosage of Lira as 62.5 μg/kg d (half of the minimum HD for its hypoglycemic activity) once a day (qd) after 4 dpi (Figure 1D) in batches 3 and 4. At each time point, there was no significant difference between Ctrl and Ctrl + Lira group or EAE and EAE + Lira group, suggesting that this dosage of Lira did not affect random blood glucose significantly. However, the EAE group and EAE + Lira group both had an approximate 30–50% reduction in random blood glucose level compared with the Ctrl group and Ctrl + Lira group (p < 0.05), suggesting that EAE induction itself could cause a decrease in random blood glucose level. EAE versus Lira in blood glucose and insulin levels: Moreover, the blood serum insulin level was monitored by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) when the animal was sacrificed or in its moribund state (Figure 1E) in batches 5 and 6, and an unsignificant increasing trend of insulin was observed in EAE group compared with Ctrl group (49.61±21.48 ng/ml versus 37.39 ± 22.06 ng/ml, p = 0.095). Meanwhile, the EAE + Lira group with the Lira dosage of 20–60 μg/kg d qod after 8 dpi had significantly decreased insulin level compared with the EAE group (29.11 ± 7.40 ng/ml, p = 0.017). Interestingly, blood serum of 2 unexpected dead mice after Lira administration was luckily obtained in their moribund state, and the values were high (82.12 ng/ml and 51.70 ng/ml, respectively). Lira ameliorated demyelination as well as inflammation and regulated Th cell transcription: The protective therapeutic effect of Lira was semi‐quantitatively confirmed by Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining (Figure 2A–C) and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining (Figure 2D–F). The lumbar spinal cord cross sections showed massive demyelination and extensive inflammation cell infiltration foci of EAE mice on disease peak, while Ctrl group did not manifest any demyelination and inflammation signs. However, Lira administration ameliorates the demyelination and reduces the inflammation foci, with significant semi‐quantitative demyelination, and inflammation score decreased compared with the EAE group (EAE + Lira versus EAE, 1.35 ± 0.31 versus 2.33 ± 0.85 for demyelination score, and 2.08 ± 0.20 versus 3.25 ± 0.74 for inflammation score) (Figure 2P–R). In addition, representative myelin basic protein immunofluorescence staining (Figure 2G–I) also showed the same result with LFB staining findings, while representative 4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole staining (Figure 2J–L) and ionized calcium‐binding adapter molecule 1 immunofluorescence staining (Figure 2M–O) supported the HE staining findings (statistical analysis was not conducted with these 3 morphological tests). Liraglutide administration ameliorated demyelination and inflammation in lumbar spinal cord of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) mice. (A–C) shows representative lumbar spinal cord cross section Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining for different groups of mice, which reflects the degree of demyelination. (D–F) shows representative hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining for different groups, which reflects the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration. (G–I) shows representative myelin basic protein (MBP) immunofluorescence staining for different groups. (J–L) shows representative 4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI) staining for different groups. (M–O) shows representative ionized calcium‐binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba‐1) immunohistochemical staining for different groups. The scale bar is 200 μm. (P and Q) shows the semi‐quantitative demyelination score (based on LFB staining) and inflammation score (based on HE staining). N = 4 per group. * represents p < 0.05, ** represents p < 0.01. Data were shown in the form of mean ± SEM. The black scatters represent average scores of samples, and the red scatters represent score given by the first observer. (R) Schematic figure to illustrate the process of semi‐quantitative evaluation for LFB and HE staining slices. Six of 10 fields (squares in the picture) were selected randomly by two observers blinded to the grouping information, and the average score was used to represent the extent of demyelination and inflammation for one slice. The inflammation score scale is 0 (normal); 1 (lymphocyte infiltration around meninges and blood vessels); 2 (1–10 lymphocytes in a field); 3 (11–100 lymphocytes in a field); 4 (over 100 lymphocytes in a field). And the demyelination score scale is 0 (normal); 1(small regions of sporadic myelin sheath loss); 2 (a few areas of myelin sheath loss); 3 (massive myelin sheath loss) Lira ameliorated demyelination as well as inflammation and regulated Th cell transcription: Moreover, Lira administration reduces key general pro‐inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression in nerve tissue (Figure 3A–C), including tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), Interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), and Interleukin‐6 (IL‐6). In the EAE situation, those cytokines mRNA expressions were all upregulated 5–23‐fold compared with the Ctrl group, while Lira intervention downregulated them (among them, TNF‐α did not reach statistical significance). Liraglutide administration reduced pro‐inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression in nerve tissue, regulated T helper (Th) cell‐related mRNA transcription in spleen, and enhanced adenosine monophosphate‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in nerve tissue (n ≥ 4 per group). * represents p < 0.05, ** represents p < 0.01. Data were shown in the form of mean ± SEM. (A–C) shows typical pro‐inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression level in nerve tissue. (D–F) shows typical Th cells related mRNA expression level in spleen. (G) shows GLP‐1R mRNA expression level in nerve tissue. (H and J) shows phosphorylation level of AMPK in nerve tissue. (I) shows SIRT1 mRNA expression level in nerve tissue Lira ameliorated demyelination as well as inflammation and regulated Th cell transcription: Th cells in the spleen are highly related to EAE pathogenesis, and Th cell‐related transcription was also found regulated by Lira intervention (Figure 3D–F). Th17 cell‐related mRNA, RAR‐related orphan receptor gamma (RORγt), and Th1 cell‐related mRNA T‐box 21 (Tbet) were upregulated by twofold in the EAE group compared with Ctrl group, which is widely considered detrimental to EAE progress, while Lira reduces these mRNA expression levels. In addition, regulatory T (Treg) (which is considered to retard the autoimmune reactions and alleviate EAE severity) cell‐related mRNA transforming growth factor‐β (TGFβ) unsiginificantly decreased in EAE situation and was restored after Lira administration. The molecular protective mechanism of Lira in the EAE model: Through literature review, some pathways were focused on to investigate whether they were enrolled in the protective effect of Lira on EAE. First, as it is reported that EAE could downregulate GLP‐1R expression, the GLP‐1R mRNA expression level was tested and found downregulated to 28.81 ± 5.41% of Ctrl group after EAE induction. However, Lira intervention could unsignificantly elevate the GLP‐1R expression to 78.71 ± 60.50% of the Ctrl group (Figure 3G). Next, we tested how AMPK and autophagy pathways changed after EAE induction and with Lira intervention. WB results of lumbar spinal cord exhibited significantly reduced phosphorylated AMPK expression level in EAE situation, and Lira administration partly restored the expression level (Figure 3H,J). Meanwhile, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1, downstream molecules of AMPK) mRNA expression level was found impaired in the EAE situation, and Lira intervention unsignificantly elevated it (Figure 3I). Phosphorylation of AMPK can lead to signal transduction cascades and then affect the activity of autophagy. Thus, the mRNA expression level of autophagy symbols, namely p62, LC3, and beclin1, was tested and found to have a 63–87% reduction after EAE induction, while Lira administration did not significantly affect them (Figure 4A–C). Meanwhile, p62, beclin1, and LC3 protein expression levels were also tested in EAE mice and found a significantly 37–50% decrease in soluble protein extracts (Figure 4D–I). Different from their corresponding mRNA trend, they could be restored through Lira intervention. Additionally, LC3 level in insoluble protein extracts also unsignificantly dropped in EAE and partly restored by Lira intervention (Figure 4J–K), indicating an impaired autophagy flux in EAE could be partly salvaged by Lira intervention. Autophagy was inhibited after experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) induction, and Liraglutide intervention could partly restore the autophagy level (n ≥ 4 per group). * represents p < 0.05, ** represents p < 0.01, *** represents p < 0.001 and **** represents p < 0.0001. Data were shown in the form of mean ± SEM. (A–C) shows RT‐qPCR result of key autophagy indicators mRNA expression level. (D–I) shows WB result of key autophagy indicators protein expression level in soluble protein extracts. (J and K) shows WB result of LC3 protein expression level in insoluble protein extracts The molecular protective mechanism of Lira in the EAE model: Finally, pyroptosis‐related NLRP3‐ASC‐caspase 1‐GSDMD, IL1β, and IL‐18 pathway were tested in nerve tissue. The mRNA expression level of NLRP3, ASC, caspase 1, and GSDMD increased 3–15‐fold significantly in EAE situation, while GSDMD was significantly downregulated accompanied with NLRP3 and caspase 1 unsignificantly downregulated with Lira intervention (Figure 5A–D). Similarly, caspase 1 protein expression level significantly increased, and IL‐18 protein expression level unsignificantly increased in EAE group (Figure 5E–H), but Lira intervention could only significantly downregulate the protein level of caspase 1, not IL‐18, indicating Lira intervention could partly inhibit the activated pyroptosis‐related NLRP3 pathway. Liraglutide administration inhibited pyroptosis‐related NLR Family, pyrin domain‐containing protein 3 (NLRP3) signaling pathway (n ≥ 3 per group). * represents p < 0.05, ** represents p < 0.01, *** represents p < 0.001. Data were shown in the form of mean ± SEM. (A–D) shows result of key pyroptosis indicators mRNA expression level. (E–H) shows result of key pyroptosis indicators protein expression level The molecular protective mechanism of Lira in the EAE model: In a word, EAE could reduce the expression of GLP‐1R, downregulate the phosphorylation level of AMPK, decrease SIRT1 expression, hold back autophagy influx, and activate pyroptosis‐related NLRP3 pathway, while Lira intervention could increase phosphorylation of AMPK, elevate SIRT1 expression level, restart autophagy influx, and inhibit pyroptosis‐related NLRP3 pathway, thus may help exert its neuroprotective anti‐demyelination and anti‐inflammation roles. Lira treatment in pyroptosis of BV2 cells in vitro: As the animal experiment earlier indicated, there was an inhibition effect of Lira on the NLRP3 pathway, and the previous study shows that GLP‐1R is expressed in cell membranes of microglia, a murine microglial cell line BV2 was used to construct a pyroptosis model, and test anti‐pyroptosis activity of Lira in vitro. Lira treatment in pyroptosis of BV2 cells in vitro: Through literature review, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and nigericin were chosen to construct the pyroptosis model. First, a concentration gradient of LPS (4 h incubation) was tested on BV2 cells, ranging from 0.1 μg/ml to 1.0 μg/ml. Results showed that all the concentrations could activate BV2 cell and enhance its viability (Figure 6A), but 1.0 μg/ml had the statistically strongest activation effect in our gradient. Thus, 1.0 μg/ml LPS incubation for 4 h was selected for subsequent experiments. Then, LPS‐primed cells were challenged by gradient concentration of ATP (2 h) or nigericin (4 h) to induce pyroptosis. Results showed that ATP concentration above 0.1 mM and nigericin concentration above 5 nM showed the significant effect to dampen the cell viability (Figure 6B,C), and under the phase‐contrast microscopy, cells manifested round shape and lost their projections after the challenge (Figure 6O–Q). Furthermore, with the validation of SEM morphological evaluation, the cells challenged by nigericin (Figure 6D) showed a flattened shape with pores on the cell body, which was characterized for pyroptosis, while LPS‐primed cells (Figure 6E,F) showed extended projections and coarse surface of soma compared with unprimed negative cell (Figure 6G,H), indicating its activated state. However, a large proportion of ATP‐challenged cells showed apoptosis‐like characters such as cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing (data not shown); thus, nigericin was chosen for subsequent experiments. An in vitro microglia pyroptosis model showed that Liraglutide (Lira) could not significantly salvage the cell from pyroptosis. * represents p < 0.05, ** represents p < 0.01, *** represents p < 0.001 and **** represents p < 0.0001. Data were shown in the form of mean ± SEM. (A) shows Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) results after 4 h of gradient concentration lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation (OD450 values were compared with Ctrl group), 1.0 μg/ml LPS manifested most profound stimulation effect and was selected for subsequent experiments. Thus, in (B and C), gradient nigericin and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were used to incubate with LPS‐primed BV2 cells for 4 h and 2 h, respectively, to induce pyroptosis, and CCK8 test was conducted (OD450 values were compared with LPS‐primed group). (D‐H) shows representative scanning electron microscope pictures of differentially treated cells. D shows a pyroptosis BV2 cell induced by nigericin, which was flattened and pored, E and F shows LPS‐primed cell, which had long projections and rugged activated soma, G and H shows a normal BV2 cell which is not primed by LPS and exhibits shorter projections and soma with smoother surface (scale bar = 5 μm). Then LPS + nigericin was chosen to build the pyroptosis model. (I) shows after incubation of gradient concentrations of Lira for 24 h then induced for pyroptosis, the CCK8 result for different groups (OD450 values were compared with LPS‐primed group). (J) shows the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release proportion of different groups and (K) shows dead cell proportion of different groups. (L–N) shows representative PI‐Hoechst33258 staining images of different groups and (O–Q) shows representative phase‐contrast microscope images of different groups (scale bar = 50 μm). After pyroptosis induction, BV2 cell lost projections and turns into a round shape Lira treatment in pyroptosis of BV2 cells in vitro: Next, gradient concentrations of Lira ranging from 50 nM to 2000 nM were used to incubate the BV2 cell for 24 h as a preventive treatment, while in the LPS group and pyroptosis (Pyro) group, the cell was incubated with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) instead. After the incubation, cells were induced to pyroptosis except for the LPS group (in the LPS group, cells were only primed by LPS, not challenged by nigericin), and then, CCK8 test was performed and the value of OD450 in every group was compared with the LPS group for normalization. Results (Figure 6I) showed that only the concentration of 500 nM Lira had a significant protective effect on pyroptosis. However, the experiments on this concentration were repeated 5 times, and only 2 times gave positive results, indicating Lira was not strong enough to stop pyroptosis. Still, the Lira concentration of 500 nM was chosen for the subsequent experiment. Lira treatment in pyroptosis of BV2 cells in vitro: Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release experiment and dead/live cell staining experiment were conducted for further validation of anti‐pyroptosis effect of Lira, among LPS group (only primed by LPS not challenged by nigericin after 24 h incubation with DMEM), Pyro group (induced for pyroptosis after 24 h incubation with DMEM), and Pyro + Lira group (induced for pyroptosis after incubation with 500 nM Lira for 24 h). Results showed that the Pyro group had 3 times increase in LDH release compared with the LPS group (Figure 6J), while there was no statistical difference between the Pyro group and Pyro + Lira group. Similarly, dead cell proportion increased 3 times in the Pyro group, but it was not statistically different from Pyro + Lira group (Figure 6K,L–Q). Lira treatment in pyroptosis of BV2 cells in vitro: To sum up, Lira could not significantly stop the pyroptosis of BV2 cells in vitro but had a trend to ameliorate it.",
            "DISCUSSION": "In this study, Lira, to our knowledge, for the first time to be demonstrated having anti‐inflammation and anti‐demyelination roles in the mice EAE model. Similar to the effect of Lira on the rat EAE model,\n Lira significantly delays the disease onset and alleviates the disease severity. Moreover, as a supplement to a previous study on rats, the neuroprotective effect was also semi‐quantitatively confirmed pathologically, with less inflammatory cell infiltration and white matter demyelination in EAE model. GLP‐1R is distributed in immune organs, including thymus and spleen, and various types of immune cells such as T cells,\n, \n natural killer T cells,\n microglia,\n monocytes, and macrophages,\n being capable of regulating peripheral Treg cells proportion.\n Moreover, in previous research, Th17 and Th1 infiltration in nerve tissue are reduced by GLP‐1R activation in the EAE model.\n In line with this finding, Lira regulated the Th cell‐related transcription in the spleen, reduced the pathogenic Th1‐and Th17‐related transcriptions in our data. GLP‐1R is observed to accumulate after nerve tissue injury,\n, \n but decreased in EAE‐challenged nerve tissue\n, \n and LPS‐primed microglia,\n indicating impaired GLP‐1R downstream pathways may participate in the pathogenesis of EAE. In our study, GLP‐1R also decreased during the acute phase of EAE and unsignificantly restored by GLP‐1R activation. Lira is demonstrated to ameliorate neuroinflammation, improve memory function, and reduce amyloid‐β deposition and oxidative injury in Alzheimer's disease animal model,\n, \n, \n and the mechanisms include but not limited to facilitating insulin signaling pathways, activating cAMP/PKA pathways, and PI3K/Akt pathways, thus restored GLP‐1R level might benefit to exert neuroprotective roles. AMPK can downregulate inflammation pathways through many downstream molecules such as SIRT1, p53, and peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor γ coactivator‐1, then inhibit nuclear factor‐kB, and indirectly suppress pro‐inflammatory gene transcriptions.\n, \n Moreover, activation of AMPK can phosphorylate tuberous sclerosis complex 1/tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC1/TSC2) and raptor, affect mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and then promote autophagy level.\n There was a restoration of pAMPK and its downstream SIRT1 expression level after Lira treatment in our data, but previous findings of the interactions between Lira and AMPK are controversial. On the one hand, accumulating evidence showed that GLP‐1R activation could elevate pAMPK and autophagy level,\n, \n but on the other hand, Lira can mainly activate PI3K/Akt pathways through GLP‐1R signal transduction, which may elevate cell ATP level, inhibit downstream TSC1/TSC2, or directly phosphorylate AMPK at Ser485 in α1 subunit or Ser491 in α2 subunit, to reduce Thr172 phosphorylation then inhibit AMPK activity and autophagy.\n, \n, \n The effect and mechanism of GLP‐1R activation on AMPK phosphorylation should be investigated in more details in the future. LC3, p62, and beclin1 are the main molecules facilitating autophagosome assembly and representing autophagy level, while there are also ambivalent findings of whether these autophagy indicators are upregulated or downregulated in the spinal cord after EAE induction,\n, \n, \n probably because that spinal cord contains a plethora of different cells, and autophagy might play different roles in different types of cells in EAE pathogenesis, including positively contributing to both autoimmune T‐cell pathogenicity and neuron survival, thus yielding variable results.\n In our study, the overall spinal cord level of beclin1, p62, and LC3 was all downregulated after EAE induction, indicating an impaired autophagy influx within the spinal cord, while Lira could partly restore it. Accumulating evidence showed that NLRP3 inflammasome is activated during the pathogenesis of MS/EAE, and its downstream products, including IL‐1β and IL‐18, can compromise the blood‐brain barrier, induce neural toxicity, stimulate autoimmune T cells and then deteriorate MS/EAE.\n, \n, \n, \n Moreover, NLRP3 can activate caspase 1 and splice GSDMD, then form membranes pore to induce pyroptosis, and exacerbate the inflammation. In our study, the overall level of pyroptosis‐related NLRP3 pathway indicators was upregulated after EAE induction, in line with previous data, while partly restored by Lira intervention, suggesting an anti‐pyroptosis effect of Lira. Actually, Lira has already been demonstrated to ameliorate pyroptosis in cardiomyoblast cell lines (H9c2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines through increasing SIRT1 expression level, reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species, and promoting mitophagy.\n, \n Microglia is a kind of important residential innate immune cell, participates in demyelinating pathogenesis, and incretins showed properties to alleviate microglia activation, reduce oxidative stress, and pro‐inflammatory cytokines transcription.\n, \n, \n In our study, we tested whether Lira can significantly alleviate the pyroptosis of microglia and receive a negative result. However, there was still an alleviation trend, and we only tested on cell lines; thus, experiments of Lira on primary microglia culture can be done to validate the result. Interestingly, the dosage of Lira we tested on EAE is only 1/10 of the minimum HD for its hypoglycemic effect. According to our calculation, Lira was tested safe for its threefold minimum hypoglycemic HD on rat EAE model,\n and another GLP‐1R agonist dulaglutide was tested safe for its minimum hypoglycemic HD on mice EAE model.\n On the one hand, our results implicated that Lira may exert its anti‐inflammatory and anti‐demyelinating effects independent of its hypoglycemic effect; on the other hand, possible reasons for unexpected death for EAE mice after Lira administration remain to be investigated. A possible conjecture we made is the EAE mice would lose weight, and Lira administration might cause extra body weight loss and probably some digestive system symptoms such as nausea and anorexia, then cause general weakness and possible hypoglycemia, and finally cause unexpected death. In this regard, we monitored the random blood glucose level and insulin level accordingly. Intriguingly, EAE itself caused significant blood glucose reduction, but Lira did not have an extra hypoglycemic effect. Moreover, there was an unsignificant upregulating trend of blood serum insulin level after EAE induction. Through literature review, we do not acquire much information about the relationship between EAE and insulin excretion, which should be investigated more in the future.",
            "LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES": "The reason for unexpected death caused by Lira administration in the mice EAE model could be investigated, and serial dosage of Lira as either prophylactic or therapeutic interventions could be tried on the EAE model to find the optimal dosage. Moreover, the mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of Lira should be investigated in‐depth in the future.",
            "CONCLUSION": "Liraglutide administration could ameliorate the disease score of EAE mice and delay the disease onset, ameliorate demyelination and inflammation in nerve tissue, and regulate Th cell transcription in the spleen of EAE mice. The protective effect of liraglutide in the EAE model may be related to regulation of AMPK pathway and autophagy, as well as inhibition of pyroptosis‐related NLRP3 pathway, but liraglutide treatment could not significantly inhibit pyroptosis of BV2 cells in vitro. Our study provides liraglutide as a potential therapeutic candidate for MS treatment.",

Thus, we aim to evaluate whether the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide (Lira) could ameliorate central nervous system demyelination and inflammation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe therapeutic effect of Lira was tested on experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) in vivo and a microglia cell line BV2 in vitro.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLira administration could ameliorate the disease score of EAE mice, delay the disease onset, ameliorate pathological demyelination and inflammation score in lumbar spinal cord, reduce pathogenic T helper cell transcription in spleen, restore phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (pAMPK) level, autophagy level, and inhibit pyroptosis-related NLR family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) pathway in lumbar spinal cord. Additionally, cell viability test, lactate dehydrogenase release test, and dead/live cell staining test for BV2 cells showed Lira could not salvage BV2 from nigericin-induced pyroptosis significantly.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nLira has anti-inflammation and anti-demyelination effect on EAE mice, and the protective effect of Lira in the EAE model may be related to regulation of pAMPK pathway, autophagy, and NLRP3 pathway. However, Lira treatment cannot significantly inhibit pyroptosis of BV2 cells in vitro. Our study provides Lira as a potential candidate for Multiple Sclerosis treatment.",
