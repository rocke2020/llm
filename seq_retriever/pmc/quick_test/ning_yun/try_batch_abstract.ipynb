      "            BACKGROUND Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secreted from atrial myocytes is shown to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and immunomodulatory effects. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of ANP on bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia-derived neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment.   METHODS LPS (5 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally to mice. Recombinant human ANP (rhANP) (1.0 mg/kg) was injected intravenously 24 h before and/or 10 min after LPS injection. Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) was performed 14 days before LPS injection or 28 days before fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). ANA-12 (0.5 mg/kg) was administrated intraperitoneally 30 min prior to rhANP treatment.   RESULTS LPS (5.0 mg/kg) induced remarkable splenomegaly and an increase in the plasma cytokines at 24 h after LPS injection. There were positive correlations between spleen weight and plasma cytokines levels. LPS also led to increased protein levels of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule (iba)-1, cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the hippocampus. LPS impaired the natural and learned behavior, as demonstrated by an increase in the latency to eat the food in the buried food test and a decrease in the number of entries and duration in the novel arm in the Y maze test. Combined prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with rhANP reversed LPS-induced splenomegaly, hippocampal and peripheral inflammation as well as cognitive impairment. However, rhANP could not further enhance the protective effects of SDV on hippocampal and peripheral inflammation. We further found that PGF mice transplanted with fecal bacteria from rhANP-treated endotoxemia mice alleviated the decreased protein levels of hippocampal polyclonal phosphorylated tyrosine kinase receptor B (p-TrkB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cognitive impairment, which was abolished by SDV. Moreover, TrkB/BDNF signaling inhibitor ANA-12 abolished the improving effects of rhANP on LPS-induced cognitive impairment.   CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that rhANP could mitigate LPS-induced hippocampal inflammation and cognitive dysfunction through subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve-mediated gut microbiota-brain axis.\n",

      "            High-fat diet (HFD)-induced comorbid cognitive and behavioural impairments are thought to be the result of persistent low-grade neuroinflammation. Metformin, a first-line medication for the treatment of type-2 diabetes, seems to ameliorate these comorbidities, but the underlying mechanism(s) are not clear. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are neuroprotective peptides endowed with anti-inflammatory properties. Alterations to the PACAP/VIP system could be pivotal during the development of HFD-induced neuroinflammation. To unveil the pathogenic mechanisms underlying HFD-induced neuroinflammation and assess metformin's therapeutic activities, (1) we determined if HFD-induced proinflammatory activity was present in vulnerable brain regions associated with the development of comorbid behaviors, (2) investigated if the PACAP/VIP system is altered by HFD, and (3) assessed if metformin rescues such diet-induced neurochemical alterations. C57BL/6J male mice were divided into two groups to receive either standard chow (SC) or HFD for 16 weeks. A further HFD group received metformin (HFD + M) (300 mg/kg BW daily for 5 weeks) via oral gavage. Body weight, fasting glucose, and insulin levels were measured. After 16 weeks, the proinflammatory profile, glial activation markers, and changes within the PI3K/AKT intracellular pathway and the PACAP/VIP system were evaluated by real-time qPCR and/or Western blot in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. Our data showed that HFD causes widespread low-grade neuroinflammation and gliosis, with regional-specific differences across brain regions. HFD also diminished phospho-AKT(Ser473) expression and caused significant disruptions to the PACAP/VIP system. Treatment with metformin attenuated these neuroinflammatory signatures and reversed PI3K/AKT and PACAP/VIP alterations caused by HFD. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that metformin treatment rescues HFD-induced neuroinflammation in vulnerable brain regions, most likely by a mechanism involving the reinstatement of PACAP/VIP system homeostasis. Data also suggests that the PI3K/AKT pathway, at least in part, mediates some of metformin's beneficial effects.\n",

      "            For food quality and safety issues, the emergence of foodborne pathogenic bacteria has further accelerated the spread of antibiotic residues and drug resistance genes. To alleviate the harm caused by bacterial infections, it is necessary to seek novel antimicrobial agents as biopreservatives to prevent microbial spoilage. Nanoantimicrobials have been widely used in the direct treatment of bacterial infections. CNMs, formed by chitosan nanoparticles and peptides, are promising antibiotic alternatives for use as excellent new antibacterial drugs against pathogenic bacteria. Herein, the current study evaluated the function of CNMs in the protection of foodborne pathogen Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157 infection using an intestinal epithelial cell model. Antibacterial activity assays indicated that CNMs exerted excellent bactericidal activity against E. coli O157. Assessment of the cytotoxicity risks toward cells demonstrated that 0.0125-0.02% of CNMs did not cause toxicity, but 0.4% of CNMs caused cytotoxicity. Additionally, CNMs did not induced genotoxicity either. CNMs protected against E. coli O157-induced barrier dysfunction by increasing transepithelial electrical resistance, decreasing lactate dehydrogenase and promoting the protein expression of occludin. CNMs were further found to ameliorate inflammation via modulation of tumor factor α, toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) expression via inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB activation and improved antioxidant activity. Taken together, CNMs could protect the host against E. coli O157-induced intestinal barrier damage and inflammation, showing that CNMs have great advantages and potential application as novel antimicrobial polymers in the food industry as food biopreservatives, bringing new hope for the treatment of bacterial infections.\n",

      "            UNLABELLED Smoking, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and vocal fold abuse can promote the development of Reinke's oedema, leading to vocal fold dysfunction and injury. The aim of the work was to investigate the appearance and distribution of proliferation marker Ki-67 (Ki-67), interleukin 10 (IL-10), interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1α), and protein gene peptide 9.5 (PGP 9.5) in Reinke's oedema-affected larynx tissue.   METHODS A routine histological and immunohistochemical Reinke's oedema and control group patient analysis was conducted. We used the biotin-streptavidin biochemical method to detect Ki-67, IL-10, IL-1α, and PGP 9.5 The semiquantitative grading method was used to evaluate immunoreactive cells' appearance and local distribution. A Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's rank coefficient were performed.   RESULTS A low positive correlation between IL-1α epithelial and subepithelial immunoreactive cells in the patient group was found. Mann-Whitney U tests revealed significant patient and control group immunoreactive marker differences. All examined markers showed a higher number of immunoreactive structures in the patient group.   CONCLUSIONS Intensive proliferation of the surface epithelium was observed in patient tissues. The notable increase in IL-10 positive structures indicates the dominant anti-inflammatory tissue response. An increased number of IL-1α structures in the larynx epithelium and subepithelium in the patient group is linked to inflammation, proliferation, and tissue remodelling. The PGP 9.5 expression increase is involved in the morphopathogenesis of Reinke's oedema.\n",

      "            Ethyl pyruvate (EP) has profound anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Here, its effects were determined on experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) induced in mice by heart-specific myosin-alpha heavy chain peptide immunization. EP was applied intraperitoneally, daily, starting with the immunization. Severity of EAM was determined by histological assessment of immune cell infiltrates into the heart. Cells were phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry. Concentration of cytokines in cell culture supernatants and sera was determined by ELISA. EP reduced the infiltration of immune cells into the heart and lessened heart inflammation. Smaller number of total immune cells, as well as of CD11b+ and CD11c+ cells were isolated from the hearts of EP-treated mice. A reduced number of antigen-presenting cells, detected by anti-CD11c, MHC class II and CD86 antibodies, as well as of T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, detected by anti-CD4, IFN-γ and IL-17 antibodies, was determined in mediastinal lymph nodes draining the heart, in parallel. In the spleen, only the number of CD11c+ cells were reduced, but not of the other examined populations, thus implying limited systemic effect of EP. Reduced production of IFN-γ and IL-17 by myosin-alpha heavy chain peptide-restimulated cells of the lymph nodes draining the site of immunization was observed in EP-treated mice. Our results clearly imply that EP restrains autoimmunity in EAM. Therapeutic application of EP in the treatment of myocarditis in humans should be addressed in the forthcoming studies.\n",

      "            The objective of this study was to compare the molecular, physiological and microbial effects of mushroom powder (MP), vitamin D2 enriched mushroom powder (MPD2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) in pigs post-weaning. Pigs (four pigs/pen; 12 pens/treatment) were assigned to: (1) basal diet (control), (2) basal diet + ZnO, (3) basal diet + MP (2 g/kg feed) and (4) basal diet + MPD2 (2 g/kg feed). Zinc oxide supplementation improved the feed intake (p < 0.001); increased the caecal abundance of Lactobacillus (p < 0.05); increased the villus height (p < 0.05) in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum; increased the expression of chemokine interleukin 8 (CXCL8; p < 0.05); and decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene interleukin 6 (IL6; p < 0.05), tumour necrosis factor (TNF; p < 0.05), nutrient transporters peptide transporter 1 (SLC15A1; p < 0.05) and fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2; (p < 0.05) in the duodenum. Whereas dietary supplementation with MPD2 improved the gastrointestinal morphology (p < 0.05); increased the total volatile fatty acid concentrations (p < 0.05); increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine gene interleukin 10 (IL10; p < 0.05) and nutrient transporters SLC15A1 (p < 0.05), FABP2 (p < 0.05) and vitamin D receptor (VDR; p < 0.05); and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene IL6 (p < 0.05), it adversely affected average daily feed intake (ADFI; p < 0.001) and average daily gain (ADG; p < 0.05). Mushroom powder supplementation had a positive impact on gastrointestinal morphology (p < 0.05) and upregulated the expression of nutrient transporters SLC15A1 (p < 0.05) and FABP2 (p < 0.05) and tight junction claudin 1 (CLDN1) (p < 0.05) compared to the controls but had no effect on the expression of inflammatory markers (p > 0.05). Furthermore, MP reduced ADFI (p < 0.01); however, this did not negatively impact the ADG (p > 0.05). In conclusion, MP and MPD2 have limited use as commercial feed additives in replacing ZnO in pig diets as feed intake was reduced post-weaning.\n",

      "            A large number of cytokines or growth factors have been used in the treatment of inflammation. However, they are highly dependent on an optimal delivery system with sufficient loading efficiency and protection of growth factors from proteolytic degradation. To develop the immunotherapy capacity of peptide dendrimers themselves, inspired by the structure and immunoregulatory functions of mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), we thus propose a hypothesis that mannose-decorated globular lysine dendrimers (MGLDs) with precise molecular design can elicit anti-inflammatory activity through targeting and reprogramming macrophages to M2 phenotype. To achieve this, a series of mannose-decorated globular lysine dendrimers (MGLDs) was developed. Size-controlled MGLDs obtained were spherical with positive surface charges. The mean size ranged from 50-200 nm in varying generations and modification degrees. The initial screening study revealed that MGLDs have superior biocompatibility. When cocultured with MGLDs, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) acquired an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype characterized by significant mannose receptor (MR) clustering on the cell surface and the elongated shape, an increased production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, a downregulated secretory of IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and increased ability to induce fibroblast proliferation. Then in vivo studies further demonstrated that topical administration of optimized MGLDs accelerates wound repair of full-thickness cutaneous defects in type 2 diabetic mice via M2 macrophage polarization. Mechanistically, MGLDs treatment showed an enhanced closure rate, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis, along with mitigated inflammation modulated by a suppressed secretory of pro-inflammation cytokines, and increased production of TGF-β1. These findings provide the first evidence that the bioinspired design of MGLDs can direct M2 macrophage polarization, which may be beneficial in the therapy of injuries and inflammation.\n",

      "            OBJECTIVE To elucidate the protective effects of Renshen (Radix Ginseng) and Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) on myocardial infarction (MI) through regulating myocardial autophagy.   METHODS Thirty-one male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into five groups (n = 6 or 7 for each). After treatment for 3 weeks, electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and cardiac function were recorded. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to detect pathological changes in the heart. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect serum B-type brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and serum inflammatory cytokines. Metabolomic analysis was used to identify differential biomarkers of MI in rats. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to detect BNP, cTnT, TNF-α, LC3B, Beclin-1, p62, and adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression in cardiac tissue.   RESULTS Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) alone or Renshen (Radix Ginseng) plus Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) markedly ameliorated cardiac dysfunction and abnormal ECGs, demonstrated by decreases in the heart weight/body weight ratio, BNP, and cTnT. Pro-inflammation cytokine interleukin (IL)-1α significantly decreased and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 significantly increased in Renshen (Radix Ginseng) single or Renshen (Radix Ginseng) plus Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) groups compared with the control group. HE results suggested that co-treatment produced a greater reduction in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area than Renshen (Radix Ginseng) or Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) alone. Renshen (Radix Ginseng) plus Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) reversed these changes to different degrees in MI rats. Furthermore, Renshen (Radix Ginseng) plus Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) down-regulated LC3B, Beclin-1, and AMPK expression in cardiac tissue and upregulated p62 expression.   CONCLUSIONS Renshen (Radix Ginseng) plus Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) may have a greater effect on heart injury induced by MI in rats than Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) treatment alone, and the underlying mechanism may be associated with the regulation of myocardial autophagy and anti-inflammation effects. These results provide fresh insight into the mechanism of co-treatment with Renshen (Radix Ginseng) and Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) for MI.\n",

      "            Increased levels of the anti-inflammatory peptide Catestatin (CST), a cleavage product of the pro-hormone chromogranin A, correlate with less severe outcomes in hypertension, colitis, and diabetes. However, it is unknown how CST reduces the infiltration of monocytes and macrophages (Mϕs) in inflamed tissues. Here, it is reported that CST blocks leukocyte migration toward inflammatory chemokines. By in vitro and in vivo migration assays, it is shown that although CST itself is chemotactic, it blocks migration of monocytes and neutrophils to inflammatory attracting factor CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2). Moreover, it directs CX3 CR1+ Mϕs away from pancreatic islets. These findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory actions of CST are partly caused by its regulation of chemotaxis.\n",

      "            Polysaccharide A (PSA) is the immunodominant capsular carbohydrate from the gram negative commensal microbe Bacteroides fragilis that has shown remarkable potency in ameliorating many rodent models of inflammatory disease by eliciting downstream suppressive CD4+ T cells. PSA is composed of a zwitterionic repeating unit that allows it to be processed by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and presented by MHCII in a glycosylation-dependent manner. While previous work has uncovered much about the interactions between MHCII and PSA, as well as the downstream T cell response, little is known about how PSA affects the phenotype of MHCII+ APCs, including macrophages. Here, we utilized an unbiased systems approach consisting of RNAseq transcriptomics, high-throughput flow cytometry, Luminex analysis and targeted validation experiments to characterize the impact of PSA-mediated stimulation of splenic MHCII+ cells. The data revealed that PSA potently elicited the upregulation of an alternatively activated M2 macrophage transcriptomic and cell surface signature. Cell-type-specific validation experiments further demonstrated that PSA-exposed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) induced cell surface and intracellular markers associated with M2 macrophages compared with conventional peptide ovalbumin (ova)-exposed BMDMs. In contrast to macrophages, we also found that CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) upregulated the pro-T cell activation costimulatory molecule CD86 following PSA stimulation. Consistent with the divergent BMDM and DC changes, PSA-exposed DCs elicited an antigen-experienced T cell phenotype in co-cultures, whereas macrophages did not. These findings collectively demonstrate that the PSA-induced immune response is characterized by both T cell stimulation via presentation by DCs, and a previously unrecognized anti-inflammatory polarization of macrophages.\n",

      "            Geniposide (GEN) is a natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory product and plays an important role in the treatment of diabetes and diabetic complications. To explore the biological functions and mechanism of GEN in diabetic retinopathy (DR), we constructed the in vitro and in vivo model of DR by using primary cultured mouse retinal Müller cells and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. We found that GEN inhibited ROS accumulation, NF-κB activation, Müller cell activation, and inflammatory cytokine secretion both in vitro and in vivo, which is probably mediated through the Nrf2 pathway. Exendin (9-39) (EX-9), an antagonist of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), abolished the protective effect of GEN on high glucose- (HG-) induced Müller cells. Additionally, GEN decreased hyperglycemia-induced damage to Müller cells and blood-retinal barrier in the retinas of mice with DR. We demonstrated that GEN was capable of protecting Müller cells and mice from HG-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, which is mostly dependent on the Nrf2 signaling pathway through GLP-1R. GEN may be an effective approach for the treatment of DR.\n",

      "            Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder with insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion that can cause complications, including liver injury. Polyethylene glycol loxenatide (PEG-Loxe), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog, is widely used to treat T2DM. However, its specific glucose-lowering and hepatoprotective mechanisms of action have not been established yet. METHODS: Using a high glucose-induced hepatocyte injury model and a type 2 diabetic db/db mouse model, we assessed PEG-Loxe's impact on reducing blood glucose and improving liver injury in T2DM and revealed its mechanism. RESULTS: PEG-Loxe treatment significantly reduced body weight and fasting glucose, increased glucose tolerance, improved serum and liver biochemical parameters (glycated hemoglobin, serum insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase), and attenuated hepatic steatosis and liver and pancreatic tissue damages in db/db mice. Additionally, PEG-Loxe considerably inhibited oxidative stress, decreased pro-inflammatory factor (TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1) levels, and increased anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 levels. PEG-Loxe possibly inhibits hepatic lipid synthesis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response by upregulating Sirt1, p-AMPK, and p-ACC expressions in the Sirt1/AMPK/ACC pathway of lipid metabolism, thereby improving T2DM liver injury. PEG-Loxe most likely also promotes GLP-1R expression by inhibiting β-cell apoptosis, which in turn activates the insulin PI3K/AKT pathway to promote insulin synthesis and secretion, thereby exerting hypoglycemic effects. In vitro cellular experiments further confirmed that PEG-Loxe possibly exerts hypoglycemic effects by activating the insulin PI3K/AKT pathway. Conclusion: PEG-Loxe improved liver injury in T2DM probably by activating Sirt1/AMPK/ACC lipid metabolism pathway, and exerted hypoglycemic effects through activation of insulin PI3K/AKT pathway.\n",

      "            Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic skin disease driven by a T-cell-mediated immune response, with inflammation and pruritus being its main clinical manifestations. Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDT), which is an ancient Chinese medicine herbal formula derived from Wai-Tai-Mi-Yao, is a potentially effective treatment for AD. We aimed to clarify the anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritus mechanisms of HLJDT in AD treatment. We performed immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Luminex-based direct multiplex immunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and flow cytometry to address the abovementioned aims. HLJDT significantly reduced clinical symptoms and ear swelling in AD-like mice by inhibiting the production of cytokines [histamine, interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-31, and IL-33], substance P (SP), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV-1), and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). Additionally, HLJDT significantly suppressed the protein expression levels and positive cell percentage of CD28, CD80, CD86, CD207, CD326, MHCII, and OX40 in the lymphoid nodes. Moreover, HLJDT significantly suppressed mRNA and protein expression of tyrosine-protein kinase (JAK1), histamine H4 receptor, and IL-4Rα, as well as the protein expression of GRP, SP, and TRPV-1 in the root ganglion. Our findings indicate that HLJDT can treat AD by regulating the antigen presentation function of dendritic cells, weakening T-lymphocyte activation, and subsequently exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritus effects.\n",

      "            Objectives: Macrophages stimulated by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) play an important role in the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis. Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), mainly existing in macrophages and adipocytes, can influence lipid metabolism and inflammation regulated by macrophages. Herein, we first established the connection between intermedin (IMD: a new peptide that has versatile biological activities in the cardiovascular system) and FABP4 and then investigated the influence of IMD on ox-LDL-induced changes in RAW264.7 macrophages line. Methods: The bioinformatics analysis, such as gene ontology enrichment and protein-protein interactions, was performed. For ox-LDL-stimulated assays, RAW264.7 was first pretreated with IMD and then exposed to ox-LDL. To explore the cell signaling pathways of IMD on inflammatory inhibition, main signaling molecules were tested and then cells were co-incubated with relevant inhibitors, and then exposed/not exposed to IMD. Finally, cells were treated with ox-LDL. The protein and gene expression of FABP4, IL-6, and TNF-α were quantified by WB/ELISA and RT-qPCR. Results: In the ox-LDL-stimulated assays, exposure of the RAW264.7 macrophages line to ox-LDL reduced cell viability and increased the expression of FABP4, as well as induced the release of IL-6 and TNF-α (all p < 0.05). On the other hand, IMD prevented ox-LDL-induced cell toxicity, FABP4 expression, and the inflammatory level in RAW264.7 (all p < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of FABP4 and the anti-inflammatory effect of IMD were partially suppressed by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89. Conclusion: IMD can prevent ox-LDL-induced macrophage inflammation by inhibiting FABP4, whose signaling might partially occur via the PKA pathway.\n",

      "            Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication in critically ill patients. Accumulating evidences indicated that macrophages play an important pro-inflammatory role in AKI and isoliquiritigenin (ISL) can inhibit macrophagic inflammation, but its role in AKI and the underlying mechanism are unknown. The present study aims to investigate the renoprotective effect of ISL on AKI and the role of Formyl peptide receptors 2 (FPR2) in this process. In this study, cisplatin-induced AKI model and lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophage inflammatory model were employed to perform the in vivo and in vitro experiments. The results showed that ISL strongly relieved kidney injury and inhibited renal inflammation in vivo and suppress macrophagic inflammatory response in vitro. Importantly, it was found that FPR2 was significantly upregulated compared to the control group in AKI and LPS-induced macrophage, whereas it was strongly suppressed by ISL. Interestingly, overexpression of FPR2 with transfection of pcDNA3.1-FPR2 effectively reversed the anti-inflammatory effect of ISL in macrophage, suggesting that FPR2 may be the potential target for ISL to prevent inflammation and improve kidney injury of AKI. Take together, these findings indicated that ISL improved cisplantin-induced kidney injury by inhibiting FPR2 involved macrophagic inflammation, which may provide a potential therapeutic option for AKI.\n",

      "            In the past 2 decades, eight glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been approved for the management of type 2 diabetes, each with its peculiar molecular structure, pharmacokinetics, and metabolic effects. Along with their marked glucose-lowering actions, which occur both at fasting and in the postprandial phase without an increased risk of hypoglycemia, GLP-1RAs have provided marked reductions in body weight and ancillary improvements in blood pressure and lipid profile. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials have established the benefits of GLP-1RAs on major cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality, independent of glucose control, with minor effects on preventing hospitalization for heart failure. Novel evidence is also emerging on the protection of GLP-1RAs against diabetic kidney disease, mainly preventing the onset of macroalbuminuria. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the cardiorenal protective properties of GLP-1RAs, which may be direct or mediated by additional hemodynamic and anti-inflammatory/antioxidant effects. With their favorable cardiometabolic properties and safety profile, GLP-1RAs may offer an ideal pharmacological option for the management of diabetic kidney disease. In this review, we discuss pharmacokinetic properties, glucometabolic effects, and cardioprotective actions of GLP-1RAs, highlighting the available evidence for a kidney protective role and the proposed mechanisms.\n",

      "            BACKGROUND Recent evidence has shown dopamine as a major regulator of inflammation. Accordingly, dopaminergic regulation of immune cells plays an important role in the physiopathology of inflammatory disorders. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease involving a CD4+ T-cell-driven autoimmune response to central nervous system (CNS) derived antigens. Evidence from animal models has suggested that B cells play a fundamental role as antigen-presenting cells (APC) re-stimulating CD4+ T cells in the CNS as well as regulating T-cell response by mean of inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we addressed the role of the dopamine receptor D3 (DRD3), which displays the highest affinity for dopamine, in B cells in animal models of MS.   METHODS Mice harbouring Drd3-deficient or Drd3-sufficient B cells were generated by bone marrow transplantation into recipient mice devoid of B cells. In these mice, we compared the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by immunization with a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-derived peptide (pMOG), a model that leads to CNS-autoimmunity irrespective of the APC-function of B cells, or by immunization with full-length human MOG protein (huMOG), a model in which antigen-specific activated B cells display a fundamental APC-function in the CNS. APC-function was assessed in vitro by pulsing B cells with huMOG-coated beads and then co-culturing with MOG-specific T cells.   RESULTS Our data show that the selective Drd3 deficiency in B cells abolishes the disease development in the huMOG-induced EAE model. Mechanistic analysis indicates that although DRD3-signalling did not affect the APC-function of B cells, DRD3 favours the CNS-tropism in a subset of pro-inflammatory B cells in the huMOG-induced EAE model, an effect that was associated with higher CXCR3 expression. Conversely, the results show that the selective Drd3 deficiency in B cells exacerbates the disease severity in the pMOG-induced EAE model. Further analysis shows that DRD3-stimulation increased the expression of the CNS-homing molecule CD49d in a B-cell subset with anti-inflammatory features, thus attenuating EAE manifestation in the pMOG-induced EAE model.   CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that DRD3 in B cells exerts a dual role in CNS-autoimmunity, favouring CNS-tropism of pro-inflammatory B cells with APC-function and promoting CNS-homing of B cells with anti-inflammatory features. Thus, these results show DRD3-signalling in B cells as a critical regulator of CNS-autoimmunity.\n",

      "            Recently, several anti-inflammatory peptides (AIPs) have been found in the process of the inflammatory response, and these peptides have been used to treat some inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, identifying AIPs accurately from a given amino acid sequences is critical for the discovery of novel and efficient anti-inflammatory peptide-based therapeutics and the acceleration of their application in therapy. In this paper, a random forest-based model called iAIPs for identifying AIPs is proposed. First, the original samples were encoded with three feature extraction methods, including g-gap dipeptide composition (GDC), dipeptide deviation from the expected mean (DDE), and amino acid composition (AAC). Second, the optimal feature subset is generated by a two-step feature selection method, in which the feature is ranked by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method, and the optimal feature subset is generated by the incremental feature selection strategy. Finally, the optimal feature subset is inputted into the random forest classifier, and the identification model is constructed. Experiment results showed that iAIPs achieved an AUC value of 0.822 on an independent test dataset, which indicated that our proposed model has better performance than the existing methods. Furthermore, the extraction of features for peptide sequences provides the basis for evolutionary analysis. The study of peptide identification is helpful to understand the diversity of species and analyze the evolutionary history of species.\n",

      "            BACKGROUND Quantification of coronary artery inflammation and atherosclerosis remains a challenge in high-risk individuals. In this study we sought to investigate if the glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide has a direct anti-inflammatory effect in the coronary arteries using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer targeting activated macrophages in the vessel-wall.   METHODS Thirty randomly selected participants with type 2 diabetes from the placebo-controlled trial LIRAFLAME were enrolled in this sub-study. Participants were, prior to enrollment in this sub-study, randomized to either treatment with daily liraglutide (n=15) or placebo (n=15). Both groups underwent a combined [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE positron emission tomography and computed tomography scan of the heart at baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment. Coronary artery uptake of [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE were measured as maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax); and means of the maximum values (mSUVmax), both values were calculated at the level of each participant and each individual coronary-segment.   RESULTS SUVmax and mSUVmax values decreased significantly in the liraglutide group both at the participant level (SUVmax: p=0.013; mSUVmax: p=0.004) and at the coronary-segment level (SUVmax: p=0.001; mSUVmax: p<0.0001). No change was observed in the placebo group neither at the participant level (SUVmax: p=0.69; mSUVmax: p=0.67) or at the coronary-segment level (SUVmax: p=0.49; mSUVmax: p=0.30). When comparing the mean change in uptake values between the two groups at both the participant level (SUVmax: p=0.076; mSUVmax: p=0.077) and the coronary segment level (SUVmax: p=0.13; mSUVmax: p=0.11) a borderline significant difference was observed. Baseline SUVmax [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE uptake values showed a weak positive correlation with the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (τ =0.26, p=0.045).   CONCLUSION Liraglutide treatment for 26-weeks caused a significant reduction in [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE uptake in the coronary arteries whereas this was not seen in the placebo treated group. In addition, [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT as a marker of coronary inflammation correlated with the systemic inflammation marker hs-CRP.\n",

      "            Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious diseases caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Now, it is pandemic over the world. SARS-CoV-2 often causes a \"cytokine storm\" in people with COVID-19, causing inflammatory lung damage and pneumonia, which eventually leads to death. Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is well known as an incretin hormone responsible for regulation of blood glucose through its receptor. Beyond glycemic control, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have promising anti-inflammatory actions in human and rodent pathological models. Recent studies proved that GLP-1RAs attenuate pulmonary inflammation, reduce cytokine production, and preserve lung function in mice and rats with experimental lung injury. Moreover, a thickened pulmonary vascular wall, an important characteristic of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was observed in the autopsy lung tissue of a COVID-19 patient. Thus GLP-1RAs may be a novel therapeutic strategy for combating this pandemic specifically for patient characteristics of PHA after COVID-19 infection.\n",

      "            CONTEXT The effect of the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions of vitamin D on the duration of partial clinical remission (PR) in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is unclear.   OBJECTIVE This work aimed to determine the effect of adjunctive ergocalciferol on residual β-cell function (RBCF) and PR in youth with newly diagnosed T1D who were maintained on a standardized insulin treatment protocol. The hypothesis was that ergocalciferol supplementation increases RBCF and prolongs PR.   METHODS A 12-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted of 50 000 IU of ergocalciferol per week for 2 months, and then once every 2 weeks for 10 months, vs placebo in 36 individuals aged 10 to 21 years, with T1D of less than 3 months and a stimulated C-peptide (SCP) level greater than or equal to 0.2 nmol/L (≥ 0.6 ng/mL). The ergocalciferol group had 18 randomly assigned participants (10 male/8 female), mean age 13.3 ± 2.8 years, while the control group had 18 participants (14 male/4 female), aged 14.3 ± 2.9 years.   RESULTS The ergocalciferol treatment group had statistically significantly higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at 6 months (P = .01) and 9 months (P = .02) than the placebo group. At 12 months, the ergocalciferol group had a statistically significantly lower serum tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) concentration (P = .03). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups at each time point from baseline to 12 months for SCP concentration (P = .08), glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (P = .09), insulin dose-adjusted A1c (IDAA1c), or total daily dose of insulin. Temporal trends for rising HbA1c (P = .04) and IDAA1c (P = .02) were statistically significantly blunted in the ergocalciferol group.   CONCLUSION Ergocalciferol statistically significantly reduced serum TNF-α concentration and the rates of increase both in A1c and IDAA1c, suggesting a protection of RBCF and PR in youth with newly diagnosed T1D.\n",

      "            BACKGROUND Spontaneous coronary artery rupture (SCAR) is an extremely rare and highly lethal disease.   CASE SUMMARY A 74-year-old man who had undergone respiratory surgery (robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) presented with exertional dyspnoea since postoperative day (POD) 6. Echocardiography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed diffuse pericardial effusion, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed widespread concave ST-segment elevation. The diagnosis of acute pericarditis was made based on the absence of significant elevation of cardiac enzymes and the presence of elevated C-reactive peptide levels. The patient was started on anti-inflammatory medication, including steroids; however, on POD 11, the patient developed a sudden cardiopulmonary arrest due to cardiac tamponade. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and an emergency coronary angiography showed contrast extravasation from the left anterior descending artery to the epicardium. He was diagnosed with SCAR and underwent transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) and pericardial drainage.   DISCUSSION In this case, SCAR occurred during the course of acute pericarditis. We speculated that the cause of SCAR was more affected with pericarditis than injury by the respiratory surgery. The clinical course of acute pericarditis generally has a good prognosis, but the rare occurrence of fatal complications should be considered, suggesting the need for careful follow-up. In addition, TAE was a less invasive and feasible treatment for SCAR.\n",

      "            OBJECTIVES To explore the role of the corneal sensory nerves in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) keratitis, the synergistic effect between the sensory neurons and macrophages in calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release, and the functional mechanisms of CGRP-mediated transformation of macrophages to the M2 phenotype.   METHODS Corneal nerve loss, macrophage recruitment, and CGRP expression were evaluated. To explore the synergistic effect between the sensory neurons and macrophages, RAW 264.7 cells were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), then trigeminal ganglion (TG) sensory neurons were isolated and co-incubated with macrophages, and CGRP expression was tested. To investigate the biological function of cornea neuron-initiated immune responses mediated by CGRP, BIBN 4096BS was used to inhibit CGRP in vivo and α-CGRP was used to simulate CGRP in vitro. The expressions of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10), M1 (CD80/CD86), M2 (CD163/CD206) macrophage markers, and signal transducers (PI3K/AKT) were detected.   RESULTS P. aeruginosa infection induced corneal nerve loss, macrophage recruitment, and CGRP up-expression. CGRP was co-localized with macrophages. Co-culture showed that sensory neurons and macrophages can mediate CGRP release. More CGRP was released when the two types of cells were combined to respond to LPS. BIBN 4096BS promoted pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibited the anti-inflammatory cytokines and signal transducers, while, α-CGRP inhibited the pro-inflammatory cytokines and M1 markers and promoted the anti-inflammatory cytokine, M2 markers, and signal transducers.   CONCLUSIONS P. aeruginosa infection induces corneal sensory neuron activation, macrophage recruitment, and CGRP up-expression. The synergistic effect between the sensory neurons and macrophages promotes CGRP release. CGRP inhibits corneal inflammation and promotes the transformation of macrophages to the M2 phenotype through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.\n",

      "            Neuroinflammation is closely linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs exhibit anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects; hence, we investigated whether they reduce cognitive impairment and protect astrocytes from oxidative stress. We found that 5 × FAD transgenic mice treated with the synthetic GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide had improved cognitive function per the Morris water maze test. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and ELISAs used to detect inflammatory factors revealed reduced neuroinflammation in extracted piriform cortexes of exenatide-treated mice as well as lower amyloid β1-42-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in astrocytes treated with exendin-4 (the natural analog of exenatide). Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain containing 2 (NLRP2) revealed that exenatide/exendin-4 function may be attributed to NLRP2 inflammasome inhibition. Collectively, our results indicate that GLP-1 analogs improve cognitive dysfunction in vivo and protect astrocytes in vitro, potentially via the downregulation of the NLRP2 inflammasome.\n",

      "            Boosting transcorneal permeability and pharmacological activity of drug poses a great challenge in the field of ocular drug delivery. In the present study, we propose a drug-peptide supramolecular hydrogel based on anti-inflammatory drug, dexamethasone (Dex), and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif for boosting transcorneal permeability and pharmacological activity via the ligand-receptor interaction. The drug-peptide (Dex-SA-RGD/RGE) supramolecular hydrogel comprised of uniform nanotube architecture formed spontaneously in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4) without external stimuli. Upon storage at 4 °C, 25 °C, and 37 °C for 70 days, Dex-SA-RGD in hydrogel did not undergo significant hydrolysis, suggesting great long-term stability. In comparison to Dex-SA-RGE, Dex-SA-RGD exhibited a more potent in vitro anti-inflammatory efficacy in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages via the inhibition of nuclear factor кB (NF-κB) signal pathway. More importantly, using drug-peptide supramolecular hydrogel labeled with 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD), the Dex-SA-K(NBD)RGD showed increased performance in terms of integrin targeting and cellular uptake compared to Dex-SA-K(NBD)RGE, as revealed by cellular uptake assay. On topical instillation in rabbit's eye, the proposed Dex-SA-K(NBD)RGD could effectively enhance the transcorneal distribution and permeability with respect to the Dex-SA-K(NBD)RGE. Overall, our findings demonstrate the performance of the ligand-receptor interaction for boosting transcorneal permeability and pharmacological activity of drug.\n",

      "            Inflammatory bowel disease, an intestinal relapsing inflammatory disease, not only impairs gastrointestinal function but also increases the chances of developing colon cancer. Currently, the effects of shrimp peptide (SP) in mice model of ulcerative colitis (UC) are still unclear. In particular, it is uncertain whether SP affects the gut flora with UC mice. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of SP on a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse model of UC. Firstly, the molecular weight of SP was mainly distributed in the range of 180-1,000 Da (61.95% proportion), and the amino acid composition showed that SP contained 17 amino acids, of which, the essential amino acids accounted for 54.50%. In vivo, oral SP significantly attenuated the severity of colitis, such as diarrhea, weight loss, and rectal bleeding. Furthermore, treatment with SP remarkably ameliorated intestinal barrier integrity, thus lowering the levels of the inflammatory cytokines and ameliorating antioxidant indices and intestinal injury indicators in the serum and colon. Lastly, the cecal contents were used to sequence and analyze the 16S rRNA genes of bacteria. Results suggested that treatment with SP could restore the balance of intestinal flora in modeled mice by regulating the abundance of pathogenic and beneficial bacteria. Furthermore, SP could significantly improve intestinal flora dysfunction in mice with UC. In summary, our findings show that SP has a prophylactic and therapeutic effect in UC in vivo, thereby highlighting its broad medicinal applications.\n",

      "            Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group B streptococcus (GBS), can cause pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia, making it a pathogen that can increase the risk of death in newborns and immunodeficient individuals. Neutrophils are the first barrier to a host's innate immune defense against these infections. Fpr2(Formyl peptide receptor 2) is an important chemotactic receptor of neutrophils, though its activation would cause pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we found that mice without Fpr2 receptor were highly susceptible to GBS infections. These mice demonstrated decreased chemotaxis to neutrophils, decreased bactericidal ability of neutrophils, and high mortality. RNA-seq and Luminex assay indicated that Fpr2 activates key signal molecules downstream and produces chemokines CXCL1/2 to chemotaxis neutrophils. Like Fpr2-/-, CXCL1/2 or neutrophil depletion impairs host's ability to defend against GBS infection. Altogether, these data indicate that Fpr2 contributes to a host's ability to control GBS infection and that a lack of Fpr2 was associated with selective impairment during the production of chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 as well as neutrophil recruitment. Here, We clarified that Fpr2, as a chemotactic receptor, could not only directly chemotactic neutrophils, but also regulate the production of chemokines to control infection by chemotactic neutrophils.\n",

      "            Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an uncommon and deadly cardiopulmonary disease. PAH stems essentially from pulmonary artery (PA) remodeling induced predominantly by over-proliferation of PA smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and inflammation. However, effective treatments are still missing in the clinic because the available drugs consisting of vasodilators are aimed to attenuate PAH symptoms rather than inhibit the remodeling process. Here, we aimed to specifically co-deliver apoptotic executor gene p53 and anti-inflammatory baicalein to PASMCs to alleviate PAH. The targeted co-delivery system was prepared through a carrier-free approach, which was prepared by loading the conjugate, NLS (nuclear localization signal) peptide-p53 gene, onto the baicalein pure crystals, followed by coating with glucuronic acid (GA) for targeting the glucose transport-1 (GLUT-1). The co-delivery system developed has a 200-nm diameter with a rod shape and a drug-loading capacity of 62% (w/w). The prepared system was shown to target PASMCs in vitro and enabled effective gene transfection, efficient apoptosis, and inflammation suppression. In vivo, via targeting the axis lung-PAs-PASMCs, the co-delivery reversed monocrotaline-induced PAH by reducing pulmonary artery pressure, downregulating the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, and inhibiting remodeling of both PAs and right ventricular. The potent efficacy may closely correlate with the activation of the signaling axis Bax/Bcl-2/Cas-3. Overall, our results indicate that the co-delivery system holds a significant potential to target the axis of lung-PAs-PASMCs and treat PAH.\n",

      "            BACKGROUND Neuroinflammation is the leading cause of neurological sequelae in ischemic stroke. Recently, we reported that the anti-inflammatory mediator annexin A1 (ANXA1) favored microglial M2 polarization in brain injury. The purpose of this study was to investigate electroacupuncture (EA) treatment and its potentially ANXA1-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) mouse model of stroke.   METHODS Treatment with EA consisted of dense-sparse frequencies (alternating 4 Hz sparse waves for 1.5 s and 16 Hz dense waves for 1.5 s) at CV24 and GV26. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Boc-2 (5 µM) or short hairpin RNA (sh)ANXA1 (2 µL) 3 days before EA was performed to block the effects of ANXA1.   RESULTS EA pretreatment enhanced expression of ANXA1 and its receptor, formyl peptide receptor (FPR), when compared to MCAO/R alone. EA treatment also rescued MCAO/R-induced deficits in neurological performance, and learning and memory, and reduced infarct volume. Double immunofluorescent labeling showed that EA prevented MCAO/R-induced changes in microglial activation and morphology. EA also reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, while increasing the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as arginase-1 (Arg-1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). All EA-induced effects were either partially or completely prevented by prior administration of FPR antagonist Boc-2 or shANXA1.   CONCLUSION The current study provides strong evidence that EA treatment has protective effects against ischemic stroke in the MCAO/R mouse model and that the mechanism likely involves the promotion of M2 polarization in microglia via ANXA1.\n",

      "            BACKGROUND Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secreted from atrial myocytes is shown to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and immunomodulatory effects. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of ANP on bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia-derived neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment.   METHODS LPS (5 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally to mice. Recombinant human ANP (rhANP) (1.0 mg/kg) was injected intravenously 24 h before and/or 10 min after LPS injection. Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) was performed 14 days before LPS injection or 28 days before fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). ANA-12 (0.5 mg/kg) was administrated intraperitoneally 30 min prior to rhANP treatment.   RESULTS LPS (5.0 mg/kg) induced remarkable splenomegaly and an increase in the plasma cytokines at 24 h after LPS injection. There were positive correlations between spleen weight and plasma cytokines levels. LPS also led to increased protein levels of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule (iba)-1, cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the hippocampus. LPS impaired the natural and learned behavior, as demonstrated by an increase in the latency to eat the food in the buried food test and a decrease in the number of entries and duration in the novel arm in the Y maze test. Combined prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with rhANP reversed LPS-induced splenomegaly, hippocampal and peripheral inflammation as well as cognitive impairment. However, rhANP could not further enhance the protective effects of SDV on hippocampal and peripheral inflammation. We further found that PGF mice transplanted with fecal bacteria from rhANP-treated endotoxemia mice alleviated the decreased protein levels of hippocampal polyclonal phosphorylated tyrosine kinase receptor B (p-TrkB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cognitive impairment, which was abolished by SDV. Moreover, TrkB/BDNF signaling inhibitor ANA-12 abolished the improving effects of rhANP on LPS-induced cognitive impairment.   CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that rhANP could mitigate LPS-induced hippocampal inflammation and cognitive dysfunction through subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve-mediated gut microbiota-brain axis.\n",

      "            High-fat diet (HFD)-induced comorbid cognitive and behavioural impairments are thought to be the result of persistent low-grade neuroinflammation. Metformin, a first-line medication for the treatment of type-2 diabetes, seems to ameliorate these comorbidities, but the underlying mechanism(s) are not clear. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are neuroprotective peptides endowed with anti-inflammatory properties. Alterations to the PACAP/VIP system could be pivotal during the development of HFD-induced neuroinflammation. To unveil the pathogenic mechanisms underlying HFD-induced neuroinflammation and assess metformin's therapeutic activities, (1) we determined if HFD-induced proinflammatory activity was present in vulnerable brain regions associated with the development of comorbid behaviors, (2) investigated if the PACAP/VIP system is altered by HFD, and (3) assessed if metformin rescues such diet-induced neurochemical alterations. C57BL/6J male mice were divided into two groups to receive either standard chow (SC) or HFD for 16 weeks. A further HFD group received metformin (HFD + M) (300 mg/kg BW daily for 5 weeks) via oral gavage. Body weight, fasting glucose, and insulin levels were measured. After 16 weeks, the proinflammatory profile, glial activation markers, and changes within the PI3K/AKT intracellular pathway and the PACAP/VIP system were evaluated by real-time qPCR and/or Western blot in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. Our data showed that HFD causes widespread low-grade neuroinflammation and gliosis, with regional-specific differences across brain regions. HFD also diminished phospho-AKT(Ser473) expression and caused significant disruptions to the PACAP/VIP system. Treatment with metformin attenuated these neuroinflammatory signatures and reversed PI3K/AKT and PACAP/VIP alterations caused by HFD. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that metformin treatment rescues HFD-induced neuroinflammation in vulnerable brain regions, most likely by a mechanism involving the reinstatement of PACAP/VIP system homeostasis. Data also suggests that the PI3K/AKT pathway, at least in part, mediates some of metformin's beneficial effects.\n",

      "            For food quality and safety issues, the emergence of foodborne pathogenic bacteria has further accelerated the spread of antibiotic residues and drug resistance genes. To alleviate the harm caused by bacterial infections, it is necessary to seek novel antimicrobial agents as biopreservatives to prevent microbial spoilage. Nanoantimicrobials have been widely used in the direct treatment of bacterial infections. CNMs, formed by chitosan nanoparticles and peptides, are promising antibiotic alternatives for use as excellent new antibacterial drugs against pathogenic bacteria. Herein, the current study evaluated the function of CNMs in the protection of foodborne pathogen Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157 infection using an intestinal epithelial cell model. Antibacterial activity assays indicated that CNMs exerted excellent bactericidal activity against E. coli O157. Assessment of the cytotoxicity risks toward cells demonstrated that 0.0125-0.02% of CNMs did not cause toxicity, but 0.4% of CNMs caused cytotoxicity. Additionally, CNMs did not induced genotoxicity either. CNMs protected against E. coli O157-induced barrier dysfunction by increasing transepithelial electrical resistance, decreasing lactate dehydrogenase and promoting the protein expression of occludin. CNMs were further found to ameliorate inflammation via modulation of tumor factor α, toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) expression via inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB activation and improved antioxidant activity. Taken together, CNMs could protect the host against E. coli O157-induced intestinal barrier damage and inflammation, showing that CNMs have great advantages and potential application as novel antimicrobial polymers in the food industry as food biopreservatives, bringing new hope for the treatment of bacterial infections.\n",

      "            UNLABELLED Smoking, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and vocal fold abuse can promote the development of Reinke's oedema, leading to vocal fold dysfunction and injury. The aim of the work was to investigate the appearance and distribution of proliferation marker Ki-67 (Ki-67), interleukin 10 (IL-10), interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1α), and protein gene peptide 9.5 (PGP 9.5) in Reinke's oedema-affected larynx tissue.   METHODS A routine histological and immunohistochemical Reinke's oedema and control group patient analysis was conducted. We used the biotin-streptavidin biochemical method to detect Ki-67, IL-10, IL-1α, and PGP 9.5 The semiquantitative grading method was used to evaluate immunoreactive cells' appearance and local distribution. A Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's rank coefficient were performed.   RESULTS A low positive correlation between IL-1α epithelial and subepithelial immunoreactive cells in the patient group was found. Mann-Whitney U tests revealed significant patient and control group immunoreactive marker differences. All examined markers showed a higher number of immunoreactive structures in the patient group.   CONCLUSIONS Intensive proliferation of the surface epithelium was observed in patient tissues. The notable increase in IL-10 positive structures indicates the dominant anti-inflammatory tissue response. An increased number of IL-1α structures in the larynx epithelium and subepithelium in the patient group is linked to inflammation, proliferation, and tissue remodelling. The PGP 9.5 expression increase is involved in the morphopathogenesis of Reinke's oedema.\n",

      "            Ethyl pyruvate (EP) has profound anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Here, its effects were determined on experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) induced in mice by heart-specific myosin-alpha heavy chain peptide immunization. EP was applied intraperitoneally, daily, starting with the immunization. Severity of EAM was determined by histological assessment of immune cell infiltrates into the heart. Cells were phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry. Concentration of cytokines in cell culture supernatants and sera was determined by ELISA. EP reduced the infiltration of immune cells into the heart and lessened heart inflammation. Smaller number of total immune cells, as well as of CD11b+ and CD11c+ cells were isolated from the hearts of EP-treated mice. A reduced number of antigen-presenting cells, detected by anti-CD11c, MHC class II and CD86 antibodies, as well as of T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, detected by anti-CD4, IFN-γ and IL-17 antibodies, was determined in mediastinal lymph nodes draining the heart, in parallel. In the spleen, only the number of CD11c+ cells were reduced, but not of the other examined populations, thus implying limited systemic effect of EP. Reduced production of IFN-γ and IL-17 by myosin-alpha heavy chain peptide-restimulated cells of the lymph nodes draining the site of immunization was observed in EP-treated mice. Our results clearly imply that EP restrains autoimmunity in EAM. Therapeutic application of EP in the treatment of myocarditis in humans should be addressed in the forthcoming studies.\n",

      "            The objective of this study was to compare the molecular, physiological and microbial effects of mushroom powder (MP), vitamin D2 enriched mushroom powder (MPD2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) in pigs post-weaning. Pigs (four pigs/pen; 12 pens/treatment) were assigned to: (1) basal diet (control), (2) basal diet + ZnO, (3) basal diet + MP (2 g/kg feed) and (4) basal diet + MPD2 (2 g/kg feed). Zinc oxide supplementation improved the feed intake (p < 0.001); increased the caecal abundance of Lactobacillus (p < 0.05); increased the villus height (p < 0.05) in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum; increased the expression of chemokine interleukin 8 (CXCL8; p < 0.05); and decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene interleukin 6 (IL6; p < 0.05), tumour necrosis factor (TNF; p < 0.05), nutrient transporters peptide transporter 1 (SLC15A1; p < 0.05) and fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2; (p < 0.05) in the duodenum. Whereas dietary supplementation with MPD2 improved the gastrointestinal morphology (p < 0.05); increased the total volatile fatty acid concentrations (p < 0.05); increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine gene interleukin 10 (IL10; p < 0.05) and nutrient transporters SLC15A1 (p < 0.05), FABP2 (p < 0.05) and vitamin D receptor (VDR; p < 0.05); and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene IL6 (p < 0.05), it adversely affected average daily feed intake (ADFI; p < 0.001) and average daily gain (ADG; p < 0.05). Mushroom powder supplementation had a positive impact on gastrointestinal morphology (p < 0.05) and upregulated the expression of nutrient transporters SLC15A1 (p < 0.05) and FABP2 (p < 0.05) and tight junction claudin 1 (CLDN1) (p < 0.05) compared to the controls but had no effect on the expression of inflammatory markers (p > 0.05). Furthermore, MP reduced ADFI (p < 0.01); however, this did not negatively impact the ADG (p > 0.05). In conclusion, MP and MPD2 have limited use as commercial feed additives in replacing ZnO in pig diets as feed intake was reduced post-weaning.\n",

      "            A large number of cytokines or growth factors have been used in the treatment of inflammation. However, they are highly dependent on an optimal delivery system with sufficient loading efficiency and protection of growth factors from proteolytic degradation. To develop the immunotherapy capacity of peptide dendrimers themselves, inspired by the structure and immunoregulatory functions of mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), we thus propose a hypothesis that mannose-decorated globular lysine dendrimers (MGLDs) with precise molecular design can elicit anti-inflammatory activity through targeting and reprogramming macrophages to M2 phenotype. To achieve this, a series of mannose-decorated globular lysine dendrimers (MGLDs) was developed. Size-controlled MGLDs obtained were spherical with positive surface charges. The mean size ranged from 50-200 nm in varying generations and modification degrees. The initial screening study revealed that MGLDs have superior biocompatibility. When cocultured with MGLDs, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) acquired an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype characterized by significant mannose receptor (MR) clustering on the cell surface and the elongated shape, an increased production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, a downregulated secretory of IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and increased ability to induce fibroblast proliferation. Then in vivo studies further demonstrated that topical administration of optimized MGLDs accelerates wound repair of full-thickness cutaneous defects in type 2 diabetic mice via M2 macrophage polarization. Mechanistically, MGLDs treatment showed an enhanced closure rate, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis, along with mitigated inflammation modulated by a suppressed secretory of pro-inflammation cytokines, and increased production of TGF-β1. These findings provide the first evidence that the bioinspired design of MGLDs can direct M2 macrophage polarization, which may be beneficial in the therapy of injuries and inflammation.\n",

      "            OBJECTIVE To elucidate the protective effects of Renshen (Radix Ginseng) and Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) on myocardial infarction (MI) through regulating myocardial autophagy.   METHODS Thirty-one male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into five groups (n = 6 or 7 for each). After treatment for 3 weeks, electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and cardiac function were recorded. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was used to detect pathological changes in the heart. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect serum B-type brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and serum inflammatory cytokines. Metabolomic analysis was used to identify differential biomarkers of MI in rats. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to detect BNP, cTnT, TNF-α, LC3B, Beclin-1, p62, and adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression in cardiac tissue.   RESULTS Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) alone or Renshen (Radix Ginseng) plus Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) markedly ameliorated cardiac dysfunction and abnormal ECGs, demonstrated by decreases in the heart weight/body weight ratio, BNP, and cTnT. Pro-inflammation cytokine interleukin (IL)-1α significantly decreased and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 significantly increased in Renshen (Radix Ginseng) single or Renshen (Radix Ginseng) plus Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) groups compared with the control group. HE results suggested that co-treatment produced a greater reduction in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area than Renshen (Radix Ginseng) or Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) alone. Renshen (Radix Ginseng) plus Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) reversed these changes to different degrees in MI rats. Furthermore, Renshen (Radix Ginseng) plus Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) down-regulated LC3B, Beclin-1, and AMPK expression in cardiac tissue and upregulated p62 expression.   CONCLUSIONS Renshen (Radix Ginseng) plus Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) may have a greater effect on heart injury induced by MI in rats than Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) treatment alone, and the underlying mechanism may be associated with the regulation of myocardial autophagy and anti-inflammation effects. These results provide fresh insight into the mechanism of co-treatment with Renshen (Radix Ginseng) and Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata) for MI.\n",

      "            Increased levels of the anti-inflammatory peptide Catestatin (CST), a cleavage product of the pro-hormone chromogranin A, correlate with less severe outcomes in hypertension, colitis, and diabetes. However, it is unknown how CST reduces the infiltration of monocytes and macrophages (Mϕs) in inflamed tissues. Here, it is reported that CST blocks leukocyte migration toward inflammatory chemokines. By in vitro and in vivo migration assays, it is shown that although CST itself is chemotactic, it blocks migration of monocytes and neutrophils to inflammatory attracting factor CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2). Moreover, it directs CX3 CR1+ Mϕs away from pancreatic islets. These findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory actions of CST are partly caused by its regulation of chemotaxis.\n",

      "            Polysaccharide A (PSA) is the immunodominant capsular carbohydrate from the gram negative commensal microbe Bacteroides fragilis that has shown remarkable potency in ameliorating many rodent models of inflammatory disease by eliciting downstream suppressive CD4+ T cells. PSA is composed of a zwitterionic repeating unit that allows it to be processed by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and presented by MHCII in a glycosylation-dependent manner. While previous work has uncovered much about the interactions between MHCII and PSA, as well as the downstream T cell response, little is known about how PSA affects the phenotype of MHCII+ APCs, including macrophages. Here, we utilized an unbiased systems approach consisting of RNAseq transcriptomics, high-throughput flow cytometry, Luminex analysis and targeted validation experiments to characterize the impact of PSA-mediated stimulation of splenic MHCII+ cells. The data revealed that PSA potently elicited the upregulation of an alternatively activated M2 macrophage transcriptomic and cell surface signature. Cell-type-specific validation experiments further demonstrated that PSA-exposed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) induced cell surface and intracellular markers associated with M2 macrophages compared with conventional peptide ovalbumin (ova)-exposed BMDMs. In contrast to macrophages, we also found that CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) upregulated the pro-T cell activation costimulatory molecule CD86 following PSA stimulation. Consistent with the divergent BMDM and DC changes, PSA-exposed DCs elicited an antigen-experienced T cell phenotype in co-cultures, whereas macrophages did not. These findings collectively demonstrate that the PSA-induced immune response is characterized by both T cell stimulation via presentation by DCs, and a previously unrecognized anti-inflammatory polarization of macrophages.\n",

      "            Geniposide (GEN) is a natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory product and plays an important role in the treatment of diabetes and diabetic complications. To explore the biological functions and mechanism of GEN in diabetic retinopathy (DR), we constructed the in vitro and in vivo model of DR by using primary cultured mouse retinal Müller cells and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. We found that GEN inhibited ROS accumulation, NF-κB activation, Müller cell activation, and inflammatory cytokine secretion both in vitro and in vivo, which is probably mediated through the Nrf2 pathway. Exendin (9-39) (EX-9), an antagonist of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), abolished the protective effect of GEN on high glucose- (HG-) induced Müller cells. Additionally, GEN decreased hyperglycemia-induced damage to Müller cells and blood-retinal barrier in the retinas of mice with DR. We demonstrated that GEN was capable of protecting Müller cells and mice from HG-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, which is mostly dependent on the Nrf2 signaling pathway through GLP-1R. GEN may be an effective approach for the treatment of DR.\n",

      "            Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder with insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion that can cause complications, including liver injury. Polyethylene glycol loxenatide (PEG-Loxe), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog, is widely used to treat T2DM. However, its specific glucose-lowering and hepatoprotective mechanisms of action have not been established yet. METHODS: Using a high glucose-induced hepatocyte injury model and a type 2 diabetic db/db mouse model, we assessed PEG-Loxe's impact on reducing blood glucose and improving liver injury in T2DM and revealed its mechanism. RESULTS: PEG-Loxe treatment significantly reduced body weight and fasting glucose, increased glucose tolerance, improved serum and liver biochemical parameters (glycated hemoglobin, serum insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase), and attenuated hepatic steatosis and liver and pancreatic tissue damages in db/db mice. Additionally, PEG-Loxe considerably inhibited oxidative stress, decreased pro-inflammatory factor (TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1) levels, and increased anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 levels. PEG-Loxe possibly inhibits hepatic lipid synthesis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response by upregulating Sirt1, p-AMPK, and p-ACC expressions in the Sirt1/AMPK/ACC pathway of lipid metabolism, thereby improving T2DM liver injury. PEG-Loxe most likely also promotes GLP-1R expression by inhibiting β-cell apoptosis, which in turn activates the insulin PI3K/AKT pathway to promote insulin synthesis and secretion, thereby exerting hypoglycemic effects. In vitro cellular experiments further confirmed that PEG-Loxe possibly exerts hypoglycemic effects by activating the insulin PI3K/AKT pathway. Conclusion: PEG-Loxe improved liver injury in T2DM probably by activating Sirt1/AMPK/ACC lipid metabolism pathway, and exerted hypoglycemic effects through activation of insulin PI3K/AKT pathway.\n",

      "            Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic skin disease driven by a T-cell-mediated immune response, with inflammation and pruritus being its main clinical manifestations. Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDT), which is an ancient Chinese medicine herbal formula derived from Wai-Tai-Mi-Yao, is a potentially effective treatment for AD. We aimed to clarify the anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritus mechanisms of HLJDT in AD treatment. We performed immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Luminex-based direct multiplex immunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and flow cytometry to address the abovementioned aims. HLJDT significantly reduced clinical symptoms and ear swelling in AD-like mice by inhibiting the production of cytokines [histamine, interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-31, and IL-33], substance P (SP), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV-1), and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). Additionally, HLJDT significantly suppressed the protein expression levels and positive cell percentage of CD28, CD80, CD86, CD207, CD326, MHCII, and OX40 in the lymphoid nodes. Moreover, HLJDT significantly suppressed mRNA and protein expression of tyrosine-protein kinase (JAK1), histamine H4 receptor, and IL-4Rα, as well as the protein expression of GRP, SP, and TRPV-1 in the root ganglion. Our findings indicate that HLJDT can treat AD by regulating the antigen presentation function of dendritic cells, weakening T-lymphocyte activation, and subsequently exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritus effects.\n",

      "            Objectives: Macrophages stimulated by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) play an important role in the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis. Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), mainly existing in macrophages and adipocytes, can influence lipid metabolism and inflammation regulated by macrophages. Herein, we first established the connection between intermedin (IMD: a new peptide that has versatile biological activities in the cardiovascular system) and FABP4 and then investigated the influence of IMD on ox-LDL-induced changes in RAW264.7 macrophages line. Methods: The bioinformatics analysis, such as gene ontology enrichment and protein-protein interactions, was performed. For ox-LDL-stimulated assays, RAW264.7 was first pretreated with IMD and then exposed to ox-LDL. To explore the cell signaling pathways of IMD on inflammatory inhibition, main signaling molecules were tested and then cells were co-incubated with relevant inhibitors, and then exposed/not exposed to IMD. Finally, cells were treated with ox-LDL. The protein and gene expression of FABP4, IL-6, and TNF-α were quantified by WB/ELISA and RT-qPCR. Results: In the ox-LDL-stimulated assays, exposure of the RAW264.7 macrophages line to ox-LDL reduced cell viability and increased the expression of FABP4, as well as induced the release of IL-6 and TNF-α (all p < 0.05). On the other hand, IMD prevented ox-LDL-induced cell toxicity, FABP4 expression, and the inflammatory level in RAW264.7 (all p < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of FABP4 and the anti-inflammatory effect of IMD were partially suppressed by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89. Conclusion: IMD can prevent ox-LDL-induced macrophage inflammation by inhibiting FABP4, whose signaling might partially occur via the PKA pathway.\n",

      "            Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication in critically ill patients. Accumulating evidences indicated that macrophages play an important pro-inflammatory role in AKI and isoliquiritigenin (ISL) can inhibit macrophagic inflammation, but its role in AKI and the underlying mechanism are unknown. The present study aims to investigate the renoprotective effect of ISL on AKI and the role of Formyl peptide receptors 2 (FPR2) in this process. In this study, cisplatin-induced AKI model and lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophage inflammatory model were employed to perform the in vivo and in vitro experiments. The results showed that ISL strongly relieved kidney injury and inhibited renal inflammation in vivo and suppress macrophagic inflammatory response in vitro. Importantly, it was found that FPR2 was significantly upregulated compared to the control group in AKI and LPS-induced macrophage, whereas it was strongly suppressed by ISL. Interestingly, overexpression of FPR2 with transfection of pcDNA3.1-FPR2 effectively reversed the anti-inflammatory effect of ISL in macrophage, suggesting that FPR2 may be the potential target for ISL to prevent inflammation and improve kidney injury of AKI. Take together, these findings indicated that ISL improved cisplantin-induced kidney injury by inhibiting FPR2 involved macrophagic inflammation, which may provide a potential therapeutic option for AKI.\n",

      "            In the past 2 decades, eight glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been approved for the management of type 2 diabetes, each with its peculiar molecular structure, pharmacokinetics, and metabolic effects. Along with their marked glucose-lowering actions, which occur both at fasting and in the postprandial phase without an increased risk of hypoglycemia, GLP-1RAs have provided marked reductions in body weight and ancillary improvements in blood pressure and lipid profile. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials have established the benefits of GLP-1RAs on major cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality, independent of glucose control, with minor effects on preventing hospitalization for heart failure. Novel evidence is also emerging on the protection of GLP-1RAs against diabetic kidney disease, mainly preventing the onset of macroalbuminuria. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the cardiorenal protective properties of GLP-1RAs, which may be direct or mediated by additional hemodynamic and anti-inflammatory/antioxidant effects. With their favorable cardiometabolic properties and safety profile, GLP-1RAs may offer an ideal pharmacological option for the management of diabetic kidney disease. In this review, we discuss pharmacokinetic properties, glucometabolic effects, and cardioprotective actions of GLP-1RAs, highlighting the available evidence for a kidney protective role and the proposed mechanisms.\n",

      "            BACKGROUND Recent evidence has shown dopamine as a major regulator of inflammation. Accordingly, dopaminergic regulation of immune cells plays an important role in the physiopathology of inflammatory disorders. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease involving a CD4+ T-cell-driven autoimmune response to central nervous system (CNS) derived antigens. Evidence from animal models has suggested that B cells play a fundamental role as antigen-presenting cells (APC) re-stimulating CD4+ T cells in the CNS as well as regulating T-cell response by mean of inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we addressed the role of the dopamine receptor D3 (DRD3), which displays the highest affinity for dopamine, in B cells in animal models of MS.   METHODS Mice harbouring Drd3-deficient or Drd3-sufficient B cells were generated by bone marrow transplantation into recipient mice devoid of B cells. In these mice, we compared the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by immunization with a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-derived peptide (pMOG), a model that leads to CNS-autoimmunity irrespective of the APC-function of B cells, or by immunization with full-length human MOG protein (huMOG), a model in which antigen-specific activated B cells display a fundamental APC-function in the CNS. APC-function was assessed in vitro by pulsing B cells with huMOG-coated beads and then co-culturing with MOG-specific T cells.   RESULTS Our data show that the selective Drd3 deficiency in B cells abolishes the disease development in the huMOG-induced EAE model. Mechanistic analysis indicates that although DRD3-signalling did not affect the APC-function of B cells, DRD3 favours the CNS-tropism in a subset of pro-inflammatory B cells in the huMOG-induced EAE model, an effect that was associated with higher CXCR3 expression. Conversely, the results show that the selective Drd3 deficiency in B cells exacerbates the disease severity in the pMOG-induced EAE model. Further analysis shows that DRD3-stimulation increased the expression of the CNS-homing molecule CD49d in a B-cell subset with anti-inflammatory features, thus attenuating EAE manifestation in the pMOG-induced EAE model.   CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that DRD3 in B cells exerts a dual role in CNS-autoimmunity, favouring CNS-tropism of pro-inflammatory B cells with APC-function and promoting CNS-homing of B cells with anti-inflammatory features. Thus, these results show DRD3-signalling in B cells as a critical regulator of CNS-autoimmunity.\n",

      "            Recently, several anti-inflammatory peptides (AIPs) have been found in the process of the inflammatory response, and these peptides have been used to treat some inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, identifying AIPs accurately from a given amino acid sequences is critical for the discovery of novel and efficient anti-inflammatory peptide-based therapeutics and the acceleration of their application in therapy. In this paper, a random forest-based model called iAIPs for identifying AIPs is proposed. First, the original samples were encoded with three feature extraction methods, including g-gap dipeptide composition (GDC), dipeptide deviation from the expected mean (DDE), and amino acid composition (AAC). Second, the optimal feature subset is generated by a two-step feature selection method, in which the feature is ranked by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method, and the optimal feature subset is generated by the incremental feature selection strategy. Finally, the optimal feature subset is inputted into the random forest classifier, and the identification model is constructed. Experiment results showed that iAIPs achieved an AUC value of 0.822 on an independent test dataset, which indicated that our proposed model has better performance than the existing methods. Furthermore, the extraction of features for peptide sequences provides the basis for evolutionary analysis. The study of peptide identification is helpful to understand the diversity of species and analyze the evolutionary history of species.\n",

      "            BACKGROUND Quantification of coronary artery inflammation and atherosclerosis remains a challenge in high-risk individuals. In this study we sought to investigate if the glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide has a direct anti-inflammatory effect in the coronary arteries using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer targeting activated macrophages in the vessel-wall.   METHODS Thirty randomly selected participants with type 2 diabetes from the placebo-controlled trial LIRAFLAME were enrolled in this sub-study. Participants were, prior to enrollment in this sub-study, randomized to either treatment with daily liraglutide (n=15) or placebo (n=15). Both groups underwent a combined [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE positron emission tomography and computed tomography scan of the heart at baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment. Coronary artery uptake of [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE were measured as maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax); and means of the maximum values (mSUVmax), both values were calculated at the level of each participant and each individual coronary-segment.   RESULTS SUVmax and mSUVmax values decreased significantly in the liraglutide group both at the participant level (SUVmax: p=0.013; mSUVmax: p=0.004) and at the coronary-segment level (SUVmax: p=0.001; mSUVmax: p<0.0001). No change was observed in the placebo group neither at the participant level (SUVmax: p=0.69; mSUVmax: p=0.67) or at the coronary-segment level (SUVmax: p=0.49; mSUVmax: p=0.30). When comparing the mean change in uptake values between the two groups at both the participant level (SUVmax: p=0.076; mSUVmax: p=0.077) and the coronary segment level (SUVmax: p=0.13; mSUVmax: p=0.11) a borderline significant difference was observed. Baseline SUVmax [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE uptake values showed a weak positive correlation with the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (τ =0.26, p=0.045).   CONCLUSION Liraglutide treatment for 26-weeks caused a significant reduction in [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE uptake in the coronary arteries whereas this was not seen in the placebo treated group. In addition, [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT as a marker of coronary inflammation correlated with the systemic inflammation marker hs-CRP.\n",

      "            Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious diseases caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Now, it is pandemic over the world. SARS-CoV-2 often causes a \"cytokine storm\" in people with COVID-19, causing inflammatory lung damage and pneumonia, which eventually leads to death. Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is well known as an incretin hormone responsible for regulation of blood glucose through its receptor. Beyond glycemic control, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have promising anti-inflammatory actions in human and rodent pathological models. Recent studies proved that GLP-1RAs attenuate pulmonary inflammation, reduce cytokine production, and preserve lung function in mice and rats with experimental lung injury. Moreover, a thickened pulmonary vascular wall, an important characteristic of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was observed in the autopsy lung tissue of a COVID-19 patient. Thus GLP-1RAs may be a novel therapeutic strategy for combating this pandemic specifically for patient characteristics of PHA after COVID-19 infection.\n",

      "            CONTEXT The effect of the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions of vitamin D on the duration of partial clinical remission (PR) in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is unclear.   OBJECTIVE This work aimed to determine the effect of adjunctive ergocalciferol on residual β-cell function (RBCF) and PR in youth with newly diagnosed T1D who were maintained on a standardized insulin treatment protocol. The hypothesis was that ergocalciferol supplementation increases RBCF and prolongs PR.   METHODS A 12-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted of 50 000 IU of ergocalciferol per week for 2 months, and then once every 2 weeks for 10 months, vs placebo in 36 individuals aged 10 to 21 years, with T1D of less than 3 months and a stimulated C-peptide (SCP) level greater than or equal to 0.2 nmol/L (≥ 0.6 ng/mL). The ergocalciferol group had 18 randomly assigned participants (10 male/8 female), mean age 13.3 ± 2.8 years, while the control group had 18 participants (14 male/4 female), aged 14.3 ± 2.9 years.   RESULTS The ergocalciferol treatment group had statistically significantly higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at 6 months (P = .01) and 9 months (P = .02) than the placebo group. At 12 months, the ergocalciferol group had a statistically significantly lower serum tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) concentration (P = .03). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups at each time point from baseline to 12 months for SCP concentration (P = .08), glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (P = .09), insulin dose-adjusted A1c (IDAA1c), or total daily dose of insulin. Temporal trends for rising HbA1c (P = .04) and IDAA1c (P = .02) were statistically significantly blunted in the ergocalciferol group.   CONCLUSION Ergocalciferol statistically significantly reduced serum TNF-α concentration and the rates of increase both in A1c and IDAA1c, suggesting a protection of RBCF and PR in youth with newly diagnosed T1D.\n",

      "            BACKGROUND Spontaneous coronary artery rupture (SCAR) is an extremely rare and highly lethal disease.   CASE SUMMARY A 74-year-old man who had undergone respiratory surgery (robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) presented with exertional dyspnoea since postoperative day (POD) 6. Echocardiography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed diffuse pericardial effusion, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed widespread concave ST-segment elevation. The diagnosis of acute pericarditis was made based on the absence of significant elevation of cardiac enzymes and the presence of elevated C-reactive peptide levels. The patient was started on anti-inflammatory medication, including steroids; however, on POD 11, the patient developed a sudden cardiopulmonary arrest due to cardiac tamponade. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and an emergency coronary angiography showed contrast extravasation from the left anterior descending artery to the epicardium. He was diagnosed with SCAR and underwent transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) and pericardial drainage.   DISCUSSION In this case, SCAR occurred during the course of acute pericarditis. We speculated that the cause of SCAR was more affected with pericarditis than injury by the respiratory surgery. The clinical course of acute pericarditis generally has a good prognosis, but the rare occurrence of fatal complications should be considered, suggesting the need for careful follow-up. In addition, TAE was a less invasive and feasible treatment for SCAR.\n",

      "            OBJECTIVES To explore the role of the corneal sensory nerves in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) keratitis, the synergistic effect between the sensory neurons and macrophages in calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release, and the functional mechanisms of CGRP-mediated transformation of macrophages to the M2 phenotype.   METHODS Corneal nerve loss, macrophage recruitment, and CGRP expression were evaluated. To explore the synergistic effect between the sensory neurons and macrophages, RAW 264.7 cells were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), then trigeminal ganglion (TG) sensory neurons were isolated and co-incubated with macrophages, and CGRP expression was tested. To investigate the biological function of cornea neuron-initiated immune responses mediated by CGRP, BIBN 4096BS was used to inhibit CGRP in vivo and α-CGRP was used to simulate CGRP in vitro. The expressions of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10), M1 (CD80/CD86), M2 (CD163/CD206) macrophage markers, and signal transducers (PI3K/AKT) were detected.   RESULTS P. aeruginosa infection induced corneal nerve loss, macrophage recruitment, and CGRP up-expression. CGRP was co-localized with macrophages. Co-culture showed that sensory neurons and macrophages can mediate CGRP release. More CGRP was released when the two types of cells were combined to respond to LPS. BIBN 4096BS promoted pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibited the anti-inflammatory cytokines and signal transducers, while, α-CGRP inhibited the pro-inflammatory cytokines and M1 markers and promoted the anti-inflammatory cytokine, M2 markers, and signal transducers.   CONCLUSIONS P. aeruginosa infection induces corneal sensory neuron activation, macrophage recruitment, and CGRP up-expression. The synergistic effect between the sensory neurons and macrophages promotes CGRP release. CGRP inhibits corneal inflammation and promotes the transformation of macrophages to the M2 phenotype through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.\n",

      "            Neuroinflammation is closely linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs exhibit anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects; hence, we investigated whether they reduce cognitive impairment and protect astrocytes from oxidative stress. We found that 5 × FAD transgenic mice treated with the synthetic GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide had improved cognitive function per the Morris water maze test. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and ELISAs used to detect inflammatory factors revealed reduced neuroinflammation in extracted piriform cortexes of exenatide-treated mice as well as lower amyloid β1-42-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in astrocytes treated with exendin-4 (the natural analog of exenatide). Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain containing 2 (NLRP2) revealed that exenatide/exendin-4 function may be attributed to NLRP2 inflammasome inhibition. Collectively, our results indicate that GLP-1 analogs improve cognitive dysfunction in vivo and protect astrocytes in vitro, potentially via the downregulation of the NLRP2 inflammasome.\n",

      "            Boosting transcorneal permeability and pharmacological activity of drug poses a great challenge in the field of ocular drug delivery. In the present study, we propose a drug-peptide supramolecular hydrogel based on anti-inflammatory drug, dexamethasone (Dex), and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif for boosting transcorneal permeability and pharmacological activity via the ligand-receptor interaction. The drug-peptide (Dex-SA-RGD/RGE) supramolecular hydrogel comprised of uniform nanotube architecture formed spontaneously in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4) without external stimuli. Upon storage at 4 °C, 25 °C, and 37 °C for 70 days, Dex-SA-RGD in hydrogel did not undergo significant hydrolysis, suggesting great long-term stability. In comparison to Dex-SA-RGE, Dex-SA-RGD exhibited a more potent in vitro anti-inflammatory efficacy in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages via the inhibition of nuclear factor кB (NF-κB) signal pathway. More importantly, using drug-peptide supramolecular hydrogel labeled with 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD), the Dex-SA-K(NBD)RGD showed increased performance in terms of integrin targeting and cellular uptake compared to Dex-SA-K(NBD)RGE, as revealed by cellular uptake assay. On topical instillation in rabbit's eye, the proposed Dex-SA-K(NBD)RGD could effectively enhance the transcorneal distribution and permeability with respect to the Dex-SA-K(NBD)RGE. Overall, our findings demonstrate the performance of the ligand-receptor interaction for boosting transcorneal permeability and pharmacological activity of drug.\n",

      "            Inflammatory bowel disease, an intestinal relapsing inflammatory disease, not only impairs gastrointestinal function but also increases the chances of developing colon cancer. Currently, the effects of shrimp peptide (SP) in mice model of ulcerative colitis (UC) are still unclear. In particular, it is uncertain whether SP affects the gut flora with UC mice. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of SP on a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse model of UC. Firstly, the molecular weight of SP was mainly distributed in the range of 180-1,000 Da (61.95% proportion), and the amino acid composition showed that SP contained 17 amino acids, of which, the essential amino acids accounted for 54.50%. In vivo, oral SP significantly attenuated the severity of colitis, such as diarrhea, weight loss, and rectal bleeding. Furthermore, treatment with SP remarkably ameliorated intestinal barrier integrity, thus lowering the levels of the inflammatory cytokines and ameliorating antioxidant indices and intestinal injury indicators in the serum and colon. Lastly, the cecal contents were used to sequence and analyze the 16S rRNA genes of bacteria. Results suggested that treatment with SP could restore the balance of intestinal flora in modeled mice by regulating the abundance of pathogenic and beneficial bacteria. Furthermore, SP could significantly improve intestinal flora dysfunction in mice with UC. In summary, our findings show that SP has a prophylactic and therapeutic effect in UC in vivo, thereby highlighting its broad medicinal applications.\n",

      "            Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group B streptococcus (GBS), can cause pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia, making it a pathogen that can increase the risk of death in newborns and immunodeficient individuals. Neutrophils are the first barrier to a host's innate immune defense against these infections. Fpr2(Formyl peptide receptor 2) is an important chemotactic receptor of neutrophils, though its activation would cause pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we found that mice without Fpr2 receptor were highly susceptible to GBS infections. These mice demonstrated decreased chemotaxis to neutrophils, decreased bactericidal ability of neutrophils, and high mortality. RNA-seq and Luminex assay indicated that Fpr2 activates key signal molecules downstream and produces chemokines CXCL1/2 to chemotaxis neutrophils. Like Fpr2-/-, CXCL1/2 or neutrophil depletion impairs host's ability to defend against GBS infection. Altogether, these data indicate that Fpr2 contributes to a host's ability to control GBS infection and that a lack of Fpr2 was associated with selective impairment during the production of chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 as well as neutrophil recruitment. Here, We clarified that Fpr2, as a chemotactic receptor, could not only directly chemotactic neutrophils, but also regulate the production of chemokines to control infection by chemotactic neutrophils.\n",

      "            Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an uncommon and deadly cardiopulmonary disease. PAH stems essentially from pulmonary artery (PA) remodeling induced predominantly by over-proliferation of PA smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and inflammation. However, effective treatments are still missing in the clinic because the available drugs consisting of vasodilators are aimed to attenuate PAH symptoms rather than inhibit the remodeling process. Here, we aimed to specifically co-deliver apoptotic executor gene p53 and anti-inflammatory baicalein to PASMCs to alleviate PAH. The targeted co-delivery system was prepared through a carrier-free approach, which was prepared by loading the conjugate, NLS (nuclear localization signal) peptide-p53 gene, onto the baicalein pure crystals, followed by coating with glucuronic acid (GA) for targeting the glucose transport-1 (GLUT-1). The co-delivery system developed has a 200-nm diameter with a rod shape and a drug-loading capacity of 62% (w/w). The prepared system was shown to target PASMCs in vitro and enabled effective gene transfection, efficient apoptosis, and inflammation suppression. In vivo, via targeting the axis lung-PAs-PASMCs, the co-delivery reversed monocrotaline-induced PAH by reducing pulmonary artery pressure, downregulating the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, and inhibiting remodeling of both PAs and right ventricular. The potent efficacy may closely correlate with the activation of the signaling axis Bax/Bcl-2/Cas-3. Overall, our results indicate that the co-delivery system holds a significant potential to target the axis of lung-PAs-PASMCs and treat PAH.\n",

      "            BACKGROUND Neuroinflammation is the leading cause of neurological sequelae in ischemic stroke. Recently, we reported that the anti-inflammatory mediator annexin A1 (ANXA1) favored microglial M2 polarization in brain injury. The purpose of this study was to investigate electroacupuncture (EA) treatment and its potentially ANXA1-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) mouse model of stroke.   METHODS Treatment with EA consisted of dense-sparse frequencies (alternating 4 Hz sparse waves for 1.5 s and 16 Hz dense waves for 1.5 s) at CV24 and GV26. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Boc-2 (5 µM) or short hairpin RNA (sh)ANXA1 (2 µL) 3 days before EA was performed to block the effects of ANXA1.   RESULTS EA pretreatment enhanced expression of ANXA1 and its receptor, formyl peptide receptor (FPR), when compared to MCAO/R alone. EA treatment also rescued MCAO/R-induced deficits in neurological performance, and learning and memory, and reduced infarct volume. Double immunofluorescent labeling showed that EA prevented MCAO/R-induced changes in microglial activation and morphology. EA also reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, while increasing the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as arginase-1 (Arg-1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). All EA-induced effects were either partially or completely prevented by prior administration of FPR antagonist Boc-2 or shANXA1.   CONCLUSION The current study provides strong evidence that EA treatment has protective effects against ischemic stroke in the MCAO/R mouse model and that the mechanism likely involves the promotion of M2 polarization in microglia via ANXA1.\n",
