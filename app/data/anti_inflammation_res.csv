The present invention particularly relates to a method for improving inflammatory skin conditions. Inflammatory skin conditions are associated with altered expression of chemokines and cytokines, particularly increased activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) -1α, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). It is known that These same cytokines are also known to play a central role in the initiation of the cutaneous immune response and in fact provide a compulsory signal for epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) to migrate from the skin. ing. The migration of LC from the epidermis and their subsequent accumulation in the draining lymph nodes of the skin provides a mechanism for providing antigen transport to that site (local lymph nodes), where primary immune responses Is induced. The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that certain thioredoxin-derived peptides can inhibit epidermal LC migration, which is the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines when applied topically to the skin.

The description information:
The present invention particularly relates to a method for improving inflammatory skin conditions. Inflammatory skin conditions are associated with altered expression of chemokines and cytokines, particularly increased activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) -1α, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). It is known that These same cytokines are also known to play a central role in the initiation of the cutaneous immune response and in fact provide a compulsory signal for epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) to migrate from the skin. ing. The migration of LC from the epidermis and their subsequent accumulation in the draining lymph nodes of the skin provides a mechanism for providing antigen transport to that site (local lymph nodes), where primary immune responses Is induced. The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that certain thioredoxin-derived peptides can inhibit epidermal LC migration, which is the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines when applied topically to the skin. It is consistent with confusion. Therefore, according to the present invention, a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence KMIKP, comprising less than 70 amino acids and capable of inhibiting allergen-induced Langerhans cell migration, and WCGPCKMIKPFF (SEQ_ID_NO_A peptide that is not 19) is provided. から成る群から選択される。

Inflammatory skin conditions are associated with altered expression of chemokines and cytokines, particularly increased activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) -1α, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). It is known that These same cytokines are also known to play a central role in the initiation of the cutaneous immune response and in fact provide a compulsory signal for epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) to migrate from the skin. ing. The migration of LC from the epidermis and their subsequent accumulation in the draining lymph nodes of the skin provides a mechanism for providing antigen transport to that site (local lymph nodes), where primary immune responses Is induced. The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that certain thioredoxin-derived peptides can inhibit epidermal LC migration, which is the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines when applied topically to the skin. It is consistent with confusion. Therefore, according to the present invention, a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence KMIKP, comprising less than 70 amino acids and capable of inhibiting allergen-induced Langerhans cell migration, and WCGPCKMIKPFF (SEQ_ID_NO_A peptide that is not 19) is provided. から成る群から選択される。

Context6 provides the sequence information for ""SEQ\_ID\_NO\_13: RPRGR,"" which is a deletion peptide of SEQ\_ID\_NO\_10, consisting of amino acids 7 to 11 of the original sequence. However, Context6 does not provide any information about the function of this sequence.

To determine if ""SEQ\_ID\_NO\_13: RPRGR"" has the ability of anti-inflammation, we need to look for indirect evidence in the provided contexts. Context4 mentions that ""The peptides exhibiting wound healing activity and anti-inflammatory activity of the present invention are not limited to SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 16,"" which implies that other sequences, including ""SEQ\_ID\_NO\_13: RPRGR,"" could also have anti-inflammatory activity.

Furthermore, Context2 states that ""one aspect of the present invention provides a polynucleotide encoding a peptide exhibiting any one of the above wound healing activity and anti-inflammatory activity,"" which suggests that the ability of anti-inflammation could be determined by the specific sequence of the peptide.

Therefore, based on the information provided in Context2 and Context4, it is reasonable to infer that ""SEQ\_ID\_NO\_13: RPRGR"" may have the ability of anti-inflammation, even though it is not explicitly stated.

Experimental Results and Analysis Results measured by the experimental method are as follows. As a result of comparing, through RT-qPCR, mRNA inhibition rates of TNF-α, indicating anti-inflammatory activity of each peptide through an expression amount of mRNA of TNF-α when THP-1 cells in which an inflammatory reaction had been induced with LPS were treated with each of the novel peptides at each concentration (1 μM, 5 μM, and 10 μM), all the peptides exhibited a concentration-dependent anti-inflammatory activity of 50% or more at 10 μM, and Pep-WH-11 exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory activity at 1 μM, which is the lowest treatment concentration (see FIG. 1 ). As a result of confirming a capability of the THP-1 cells to inhibit the production of TNF-α through ELISA to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activities of the novel peptides, a low expression degree of TNF-α, i.e., inflammation-inducing activity, was exhibited in all the cases treated with the novel peptides at a concentration of 0.5 μM, compared to a none-treated control which was not treated with the novel peptides (See FIG. 2 ). When compared to E2 used as a positive control, among the novel peptides, Pep-WH-8, Pep-WH-9, Pep-WH-11, and Pep-WH-12 exhibited lower inflammation-inducing activity at all the concentrations. Through the results of the two experiments, it can be confirmed that the novel peptides according to the present invention exhibit anti-inflammatory activity, confirmed by the inhibition of TNF-α.

As a result of comparing, through RT-qPCR, mRNA inhibition rates of TNF-α, indicating anti-inflammatory activity of each peptide through an expression amount of mRNA of TNF-α when THP-1 cells in which an inflammatory reaction had been induced with LPS were treated with each of the novel peptides at each concentration (1 μM, 5 μM, and 10 μM), all the peptides exhibited a concentration-dependent anti-inflammatory activity of 50% or more at 10 μM, and Pep-WH-11 exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory activity at 1 μM, which is the lowest treatment concentration (see FIG. 1 ). As a result of confirming a capability of the THP-1 cells to inhibit the production of TNF-α through ELISA to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activities of the novel peptides, a low expression degree of TNF-α, i.e., inflammation-inducing activity, was exhibited in all the cases treated with the novel peptides at a concentration of 0.5 μM, compared to a none-treated control which was not treated with the novel peptides (See FIG. 2 ). When compared to E2 used as a positive control, among the novel peptides, Pep-WH-8, Pep-WH-9, Pep-WH-11, and Pep-WH-12 exhibited lower inflammation-inducing activity at all the concentrations. Through the results of the two experiments, it can be confirmed that the novel peptides according to the present invention exhibit anti-inflammatory activity, confirmed by the inhibition of TNF-α. The experiment for the inhibition of TNF-α is known as the most basic experiment for verifying overall inflammation inhibitory effects, through which it is confirmed that the novel peptides of the present invention can have overall anti-inflammatory effects. Example 3: Anti-Fibrotic Activity of Novel Peptides To identify an inhibitory effect of TGF-β, considered as the main cause of fibrosis, of the novel peptides Pep-WH-1 to Pep-WH-12, an experiment for confirming a TGF-β signaling inhibitory action in a HepG2 cell line was carried out as follows.

However, the specific data about the sequence ""SEQ_ID_NO_7: ALTSRVRA"" is only found in Context5.

Context5 describes an experiment where the novel peptides, including ""SEQ_ID_NO_7: ALTSRVRA,"" were tested for inflammation-inducing activity and compared to a positive control (E2). The results showed that among the novel peptides, Pep-WH-8, Pep-WH-9, Pep-WH-11, and Pep-WH-12 exhibited lower inflammation-inducing activity at all concentrations. However, the exact values or comparison for ""SEQ_ID_NO_7: ALTSRVRA"" are not provided.

Nevertheless, based on the information that all novel peptides were tested and compared to a positive control for inflammation, it can be inferred that if ""SEQ_ID_NO_7: ALTSRVRA"" had significant inflammation-inducing activity, it would have been mentioned as an exception or comparison to the positive control. Since no such exception or comparison is mentioned, it can be assumed that ""SEQ_ID_NO_7: ALTSRVRA"" does not have significant inflammation-inducing activity.

However, without specific data or values for ""SEQ_ID_NO_7: ALTSRVRA"", it is not possible to definitively conclude that this sequence has anti-inflammatory activity. The answer is based on the assumption that if a sequence does not have inflammation-inducing activity, it may have anti-inflammatory activity.

The answer is: 'No' - Based on the assumption that if a sequence does not have inflammation-inducing activity, it may have anti-inflammatory activity.

The inventors measured the IL-8 production (as a marker of inflammation) after stimulation of HT29-MTX cells incubated or not with said peptides and stimulated by TNFα. The results show that this peptide has an anti-inflammatory effect.

Context3: Although this context does not explicitly mention the sequence ""SEQ\_ID\_NO\_44: NTFLQSTINRTIGVL"", it does mention that the inventors identified anti-inflammatory peptides, all issued from a protein of 14 491,350 Da synthesized by F. prausnitzii. Since peptide 7 corresponds to a region of this protein, it supports the idea that this sequence has anti-inflammatory properties.

Context2: This context provides information about the core structure of the polypeptide of the invention, which includes the consensus sequence SEQ\_ID\_NO\_32 and SEQ\_ID\_NO\_33.

Immunol. 19, 1113 (1982)). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention describes sequences of new and useful peptides that are capable of reducing inflammatory responses associated with autoimmune diseases, allergies and other inflammatory conditions such as those mediated by the mammalian immune system. In particular, it has been discovered that the claimed pentapeptides are useful in blocking inflammation mediated by the arachadonic acid/leukotriene-prostaglandin pathway. Thus, the present peptides may be used effectively in the place of known anti-inflammatory agents, such as steroids, many of which exhibit harmful or toxic side effects. Although these peptides bear a structural similarity to the C.sub.ε 3 aa 320-324 portion of human IgE, thought to be associated with IgE Fc receptor binding (see discussion above relating to the Human IgE Pentapeptide (HEPP)), it is thought that the present mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity surprisingly does not necessarily involve blocking of Fc receptor binding. Rather, the present peptides have been shown to interact directly in the arachadonic acid-mediated inflammatory pathway and thereby reduce such inflammation."

Other amino acids having chemical properties similar to one of the specified eight groups may also be used as substituents in a particular class, for example, ornithine or homoarginine have basic side chains similar to Lys, Arg and His and may thus be effectively substituted for Lys, Arg or His. For example, both Lys and Arg have been shown to be active in the E-position of the peptide. It is expected that anti-inflammatory peptides of the present invention may also have functionally conserved amino acids substituted for one or more of their amino acids while maintaining or even increasing biological activity. As one example of the biological effectiveness of the peptides of the present invention, the peptides have been shown to be effective in reducing inflammatory responses as reflected in the arachadonic acid-induced ear edema model of inflammation. This assay is known to be relevant to the human allergic response, and demonstrates inhibitory activity of the claimed peptides as well as of HEPP (Asp-Ser-AspPro-Arg), a pentapeptide with known anti-allergic effects. In the arachadonic acid-induced ear edema model of inflammation, both classes of eicosanoids, prostaglandins and leukotrienes, are detected and their appearance preceeds both the edematous and cellular infiltrative phases. Leukotriene (LT)C 4 and LTD 4 enhance vascular permeability and may be involved in the edematous phase of an inflammatory reaction. In addition, LTC 4 , LTD 4 and LTE 4 have been shown to be equivalent to the classical slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) which functions as a primary spasmogen in asthma. The cyclooxygenase product prostaglandin (PG)E 2 is a vasodilator and serves to exacerbate the vascular permeability change induced by other mediators."

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 2.1. Platelet Factor 4 Platelet factor 4 (PF4) (SEQ. ID NO: 9), a 70 amino acid heparin-binding protein, is released from the alpha granules of activated platelets. The exact biological function of PF4 (SEQ. ID NO: 9) is not known, although PF4 (SEQ. ID NO: 9) is a member of a multigene family involved in chemotaxis, coagulation, inflammation, and cell growth (Eisman et al., 1990, Blood 76:336-344). The genomic sequence (SEQ. ID NO: 9) of the PF4 gene, and a highly homologous gene, PF4 alt, has recently been reported (Eismann et al., supra). Among the reported biological activities of PF4 (SEQ.

ID NO: 1) in inhibiting AA-induced inflammation. The most effective compounds (other than CT-112) were CT-119 (SEQ. ID NO: 21), CT-164 (SEQ. ID NO: 16) and CT-220 (SEQ. ID NO: 23). Of these compounds, only CT-164 is derived from the α-chemokine family (hENA78). A random sequence of amino acid residues, CT-120 (SEQ. ID NO: 11), was ineffective in inhibition of the AA-induced ear inflammation. Although albumin produced a modest inhibition of inflammation, this phenomenon has been observed by others and is not considered biologically significant. These results indicate that a number of peptides derived from the sequences found in both α- and β-chemokines may inhibit acute dermal inflammation. However, of the sequences tested, none were more effective than CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1). TABLE XII

Of these compounds, only CT-164 is derived from the α-chemokine family (hENA78). A random sequence of amino acid residues, CT-120 (SEQ. ID NO: 11), was ineffective in inhibition of the AA-induced ear inflammation. Although albumin produced a modest inhibition of inflammation, this phenomenon has been observed by others and is not considered biologically significant. These results indicate that a number of peptides derived from the sequences found in both α- and β-chemokines may inhibit acute dermal inflammation. However, of the sequences tested, none were more effective than CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1). TABLE XII

However, the sequence ""SEQ_ID_NO_49:TTSQVRR"" is not explicitly listed among these sequences.

Nonetheless, let's look at the context describing the methods for determining anti-inflammatory activity and the sequences that exhibit such activity.

Context3 mentions a peptide having the amino acid sequence Thr-Thr-Ser-Gln-Val-Arg-Xaa-Arg (SEQ_ID_NO_80), where Xaa is selected from the group consisting of nothing and all naturally occurring L-amino acids except Pro. The sequence ""SEQ_ID_NO_49:TTSQVRR"" shares the same structure but with a different amino acid at position Xaa. Since the context does not explicitly state that Xaa must be L-Arg, it is plausible that ""SEQ_ID_NO_49:TTSQVRR"" could exhibit anti-inflammatory activity.

Context5 mentions truncated analogs and substituted derivatives of CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1) as anti-inflammatory agents, provided that said analogs exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. This context implies that modifications to the original sequence might still result in anti-inflammatory activity.

Considering the above, the answer to the question is:

The answer is: 'Possible, based on the general description of anti-inflammatory peptides and the possibility of modifications to known anti-inflammatory sequences.'

Of these compounds, only CT-164 is derived from the α-chemokine family (hENA78). A random sequence of amino acid residues, CT-120 (SEQ. ID NO: 11), was ineffective in inhibition of the AA-induced ear inflammation. Although albumin produced a modest inhibition of inflammation, this phenomenon has been observed by others and is not considered biologically significant. These results indicate that a number of peptides derived from the sequences found in both α- and β-chemokines may inhibit acute dermal inflammation. However, of the sequences tested, none were more effective than CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1). TABLE XII

Of these compounds, only CT-164 is derived from the α-chemokine family (hENA78). A random sequence of amino acid residues, CT-120 (SEQ. ID NO: 11), was ineffective in inhibition of the AA-induced ear inflammation. Although albumin produced a modest inhibition of inflammation, this phenomenon has been observed by others and is not considered biologically significant. These results indicate that a number of peptides derived from the sequences found in both α- and β-chemokines may inhibit acute dermal inflammation. However, of the sequences tested, none were more effective than CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1). TABLE XII

Of these compounds, only CT-164 is derived from the α-chemokine family (hENA78). A random sequence of amino acid residues, CT-120 (SEQ. ID NO: 11), was ineffective in inhibition of the AA-induced ear inflammation. Although albumin produced a modest inhibition of inflammation, this phenomenon has been observed by others and is not considered biologically significant. These results indicate that a number of peptides derived from the sequences found in both α- and β-chemokines may inhibit acute dermal inflammation. However, of the sequences tested, none were more effective than CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1). TABLE XII

Of these compounds, only CT-164 is derived from the α-chemokine family (hENA78). A random sequence of amino acid residues, CT-120 (SEQ. ID NO: 11), was ineffective in inhibition of the AA-induced ear inflammation. Although albumin produced a modest inhibition of inflammation, this phenomenon has been observed by others and is not considered biologically significant. These results indicate that a number of peptides derived from the sequences found in both α- and β-chemokines may inhibit acute dermal inflammation. However, of the sequences tested, none were more effective than CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1). TABLE XII

A peptide having the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of Thr-Xaa-Ser-Gln-Val-Arg-Pro-Arg (SEQ_ID_NO_75), wherein Xaa is nothing, L-Lys, L-Orn, L-Met, L-Arg, or L-Trp, Thr-Glu-Ser-Gln-Val-Arg-Pro-Arg (SEQ_ID_NO_30), Thr-Ala-Ser-Gln-Val-Arg-Pro-Arg (SEQ_ID_NO_38), and Thr-Leu-Ser-Gln-Val-Arg-Pro-Arg (SEQ_ID_NO_59), and which peptide exhibits anti-inflammatory activity. 3.
Context2:
ID NO: 1), and derivatives and analogs of CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1), have anti-inflammatory activity in the mouse ear/arachidonic acid model of inflammation. The peptides of the invention, particularly CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1), may be particularly useful to inhibit an inflammatory response. For example, but not by way of limitation, CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1) or analogs or derivatives thereof may be used to inhibit inflammation in autoimmune diseases;, graft versus host disease, reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, and asthma. 4. DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES FIG. 1. Amino acid sequences of anti-inflammatory peptides CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1) and peptides previously designated as Wohl-2 through Wohl-8 (SEQ. ID NOS: 2-8). FIG. 2. Amino acid sequence of mature PF4 (SEQ. ID NO: 9). FIG. 3. Effects of CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1) on neutrophil cells.
Context6:
For the second set of CT-112-analogous peptides (SEQ. ID NOS: 3, 4, 6, 24-28), truncation of either end of the CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1) peptide by one or more amino acid residues significantly reduced the ability of the resulting peptide to inhibit inflammation (FIG. 8, Table XVI). These results indicate that optimal activity of CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1) is best achieved with the intact octapeptide. For the third set of CT-112 analogous peptides (SEQ. ID NOS: 25, 26, 29-73), the effect of replacement of any of the amino acid residues with its D-amino acid counterpart varied depending upon the residue replaced (FIG. 9, Table XVII). So, e.g., replacement of either L-Thr 1 or L-Thr 2 with D-Thr results in a peptide which retains substantial anti-inflammatory activity. Replacement: of Gln 4 or Arg 8 , however, significantly reduces activity."
US5776892A,SEQ_ID_NO_7,TSQVR,0.0,"After analyzing the provided contexts, the sequences mentioned are as follows:

Context0: SEQ_ID_NO_66: D-Thr-Thr-Ser-Gln-Val-Arg-Pro-Arg and SEQ_ID_NO_75: Thr-Xaa-Ser-Gln-Val-Arg-Pro-Arg
Context1: SEQ_ID_NO_80: Thr-Thr-Ser-Gln-Val-Arg-Xaa-Arg and SEQ_ID_NO_81: Thr-Thr-Ser-Gln-Val-Arg-Pro-Xaa
Context4: SEQ_ID_NO_36: ThrThrSerGlnValArgProGlu and SEQ_ID_NO_37: AlaThrSerGlnValArgProArg
Context5: SEQ_ID_NO_80: Thr-Thr-Ser-Gln-Val-Arg-Xaa-Arg and SEQ_ID_NO_81: Thr-Thr-Ser-Gln-Val-Arg-Pro-Xaa
Context7: SEQ_ID_NO_7: ThrSerGlnValArg

The sequence in question, ""SEQ_ID_NO_7:TSQVR"", is identical to the portion Thr-Ser-Gln-Val-Arg in SEQ_ID_NO_7. Now, let's see if this sequence exhibits anti-inflammatory activity.

Context3 mentions CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1) as an anti-inflammatory agent, but it does not provide enough information to conclude if the specific sequence ""TSQVR"" has anti-inflammatory properties.

Context8 provides information on SEQ_ID_NO_6 (ThrThrSerGlnVal) but does not explicitly mention its anti-inflammatory properties or lack thereof.

However, Context7 specifically mentions SEQ_ID_NO_7 (ThrSerGlnValArg) and states that it is an α-chemokine, which is a type of cytokine involved in inflammation. This context does not explicitly state that this sequence has anti-inflammatory properties, but it does not rule it out either.

In conclusion, based on the given contexts, there is not enough evidence to definitively say whether ""SEQ_ID_NO_7:TSQVR"" has anti-inflammatory properties. The most supportive context numbers are Context7 and Context8, but they do not provide clear evidence of the sequence's anti-inflammatory abilities.

The answer is: 'No'.","Context0:

ID NO: 1) in inhibiting AA-induced inflammation. The most effective compounds (other than CT-112) were CT-119 (SEQ. ID NO: 21), CT-164 (SEQ. ID NO: 16) and CT-220 (SEQ. ID NO: 23). Of these compounds, only CT-164 is derived from the α-chemokine family (hENA78). A random sequence of amino acid residues, CT-120 (SEQ. ID NO: 11), was ineffective in inhibition of the AA-induced ear inflammation. Although albumin produced a modest inhibition of inflammation, this phenomenon has been observed by others and is not considered biologically significant. These results indicate that a number of peptides derived from the sequences found in both α- and β-chemokines may inhibit acute dermal inflammation. However, of the sequences tested, none were more effective than CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1). TABLE XII

Specifically, ""SEQ_ID\_NO\_30"" is mentioned in Context10, and it has the same amino acids as ""SEQ\_ID\_NO\_30:TESQVRPR"" but with a Thr instead of a Tyr. Given that the variations in sequences discussed in the patent involve substituting specific amino acids or adding/removing residues, it is plausible that ""SEQ\_ID\_NO\_30:TESQVRPR"" could also have anti-inflammatory activity.

Of these compounds, only CT-164 is derived from the α-chemokine family (hENA78). A random sequence of amino acid residues, CT-120 (SEQ. ID NO: 11), was ineffective in inhibition of the AA-induced ear inflammation. Although albumin produced a modest inhibition of inflammation, this phenomenon has been observed by others and is not considered biologically significant. These results indicate that a number of peptides derived from the sequences found in both α- and β-chemokines may inhibit acute dermal inflammation.

Therefore, we cannot determine the ability of anti-inflammation for this specific sequence based on these contexts.

However, Context8 and Context9 provide information about ""SEQ\_ID\_NO\_11:VTRPTQRS"".

Context8 describes the sequence ""SEQ\_ID\_NO\_11:VTRPTQRS"" as CT-120, which is a random sequence of amino acid residues and ineffective in inhibition of the AA-induced ear inflammation.

Therefore, based on Context8, the answer is:

The answer is: 'No'.

Moreover, Context9 confirms that ""SEQ\_ID\_NO\_11:VTRPTQRS"" is a random sequence and does not exhibit anti-inflammatory activity.

In summary, based on Context8 and Context9, the sequence ""SEQ\_ID\_NO\_11:VTRPTQRS"" does not have the ability of anti-inflammation.

For the second set of CT-112-analogous peptides (SEQ. ID NOS: 3, 4, 6, 24-28), truncation of either end of the CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1) peptide by one or more amino acid residues significantly reduced the ability of the resulting peptide to inhibit inflammation (FIG. 8, Table XVI). These results indicate that optimal activity of CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1) is best achieved with the intact octapeptide. For the third set of CT-112 analogous peptides (SEQ. ID NOS: 25, 26, 29-73), the effect of replacement of any of the amino acid residues with its D-amino acid counterpart varied depending upon the residue replaced (FIG. 9, Table XVII). So, e.g., replacement of either L-Thr 1 or L-Thr 2 with D-Thr results in a peptide which retains substantial anti-inflammatory activity. Replacement: of Gln 4 or Arg 8 , however, significantly reduces activity.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 2.1. Platelet Factor 4 Platelet factor 4 (PF4) (SEQ. ID NO: 9), a 70 amino acid heparin-binding protein, is released from the alpha granules of activated platelets. The exact biological function of PF4 (SEQ. ID NO: 9) is not known, although PF4 (SEQ. ID NO: 9) is a member of a multigene family involved in chemotaxis, coagulation, inflammation, and cell growth (Eisman et al., 1990, Blood 76:336-344). The genomic sequence (SEQ. ID NO: 9) of the PF4 gene, and a highly homologous gene, PF4 alt, has recently been reported (Eismann et al., supra). Among the reported biological activities of PF4 (SEQ.

In addition, the present invention provides a peptide having the amino acid sequence Thr-Thr-Ser-Gln-Val-Arg-Pro-Xaa (SEQ_ID_NO_81), wherein Xaa is selected from the group consisting of nothing, L-Lys, L-Orn, L-Asn, L-Asp, L-Cys, L-Glu, L-His, L-Met, L-Ser and L-Tyr, and which peptide exhibits anti-inflammatory activity.

ID NO: 1) in inhibiting AA-induced inflammation. The most effective compounds (other than CT-112) were CT-119 (SEQ. ID NO: 21), CT-164 (SEQ. ID NO: 16) and CT-220 (SEQ. ID NO: 23). Of these compounds, only CT-164 is derived from the α-chemokine family (hENA78). A random sequence of amino acid residues, CT-120 (SEQ. ID NO: 11), was ineffective in inhibition of the AA-induced ear inflammation. Although albumin produced a modest inhibition of inflammation, this phenomenon has been observed by others and is not considered biologically significant. These results indicate that a number of peptides derived from the sequences found in both α- and β-chemokines may inhibit acute dermal inflammation. However, of the sequences tested, none were more effective than CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1). TABLE XII

These results indicate that a number of peptides derived from the sequences found in both α- and β-chemokines may inhibit acute dermal inflammation. However, of the sequences tested, none were more effective than CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1). TABLE XII

Context0 describes the claimed peptides with anti-inflammatory activity, including ""SEQ_ID_NO_1:DThrThrSerGlnValArgProArg"" which is the same as ""SEQ_ID_NO_87:TTSQVRPR"" but with D-Threonine at the first position. However, the claim does not explicitly mention ""SEQ_ID_NO_87:TTSQVRPR"" or its anti-inflammatory activity.

Context2 mentions that CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1), which is the same as ""SEQ_ID_NO_87:TTSQVRPR"" but with D-Threonine at the first position, or its derivatives may be useful to inhibit an inflammatory response in various diseases.

Context6 describes ""SEQ_ID_NO_87:TTSQVRPR"" with an amido group at the carboxyl terminal end and does not explicitly mention its anti-inflammatory activity. However, it is mentioned in Context2 that derivatives of CT-112 (SEQ. ID NO: 1) with modifications at the carboxyl terminal end may be useful for anti-inflammatory activity.

The exact biological function of PF4 (SEQ. ID NO: 9) is not known, although PF4 (SEQ. ID NO: 9) is a member of a multigene family involved in chemotaxis, coagulation, inflammation, and cell growth (Eisman et al., 1990, Blood 76:336-344). The genomic sequence (SEQ.

Context6:
Another embodiment of the present invention comprises an amino acid sequence substantially equivalent to polypeptides acting as anti-inflammatory agents for the therapy of autoimmune disease, and various acute or chronic inflammatory states such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. In embodiments of the invention, the low molecular weight polypeptide analog for IL-8 or other alpha chemokines is modified selectively to provide antagonists of IL-8. In one particular embodiment, antagonists that compete strongly with IL-8 for neutrophil binding without signal transduction are obtained by deleting Glu-Leu (amino acid residues 4 and 5). In another particular embodiment, antagonists that compete with IL-8 yet still retain antagonist properties are obtained by replacing at least residue Glu and Leu with non-polar amino acids, such as Ala, Val or Leu or other amino acids. Several low molecular weight peptide analogs of IL-8 were investigated and it has been determined unexpectedly that truncation of the form of IL-8, particularly in the N terminal region thereof, yields IL-8 low molecular weight peptide analogs having therapeutically useful properties."

In particular, it is known to this art that, in response to a proinflammatory signal (chemokines and cytokines such as interleukin I), the keratinocytes in the superficial layers of the skin release interleukin 8, which contributes to the triggering of the inflammatory response. The pharmaceutical industry has long sought to develop active agents effective for treating inflammation. Vast numbers of such active agents are known to this art and are described under the designations steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (SAID and NSAID); compare, for example, the text by Schorderet and Dayer “Pharmacologie. Des concepts fondamentaux aux applications thérapeutiques” (Pharmacology.

Aside from the fact that the known anti-inflammatory agents often exhibit not inconsiderable side effects, serious need continues to exist for novel compounds/formulations eliciting anti-inflammatory activity, in particular for minor skin disorders/afflictions such as, for example, sensitive skins, skin discomfort, skin stretching, skin itching, skin swelling, skin pain, skin flushing, heat sensation of the skin, erythemas, in particular due to ultraviolet rays, and pruritus. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, a major object of the present invention is the provision of novel anti-inflammatory active agents which are conspicuously devoid of substantial adverse side effects. Briefly, the present invention features novel anti-inflammatory compositions comprising, as the active principle therein, an effective amount of at least one peptide derivative of α-type melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), or any functional biological equivalent thereof, formulated together with at least one algal extract of marine origin. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF BEST MODE AND SPECIFIC/PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION More particularly according to the present invention, the peptide derivative is a derivative of α-type melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) or melanotropin. While α-MSH was originally described as being produced by the pituitary gland, the brain in general, the blood, the skin and other tissues are also able to produce α-MSH. Thus, it has been shown by Schauer et al. ( J. Clin."

The C-terminal tripeptide of α-MSH, KPV exerts anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in animal models of inflammation, that are similar to those of the entire 1-13 sequence. Therefore, KPV is considered the anti-inflammatory “message sequence” of the peptide. Five G-protein-linked melanocortin receptors (MC-1R through MC-5R) have been isolated and cloned. They bind α-MSH and other melanocortin peptides such as ACTH with different affinities; MC-R are expressed in the brain and in peripheral tissues. The precursor of α-MSH, POMC, is widely expressed in tissues. However, there are distinct regional differences in expression and post-translational processing and certain cells produce, constitutively or under appropriate stimulation, greater amounts of α-MSH. α-MSH occurs in high concentrations in barrier organs such as the gut and the skin.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new pharmaceutical composition and method for use as a treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”), as well as for secondary microbial infections and inflammation in persons with HIV. More particularly, this invention relates to a tripeptide sequence contained in alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (“alpha-MSH”), which has been identified as an antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory agent. HIV is a virus that weakens the immune system through destruction of lymphocytes. Because thousands of people die each year from HIV, the need for treatment of the virus, as well as secondary infections, is significant. HIV is considered to be a member of the lentivirus family of animal retroviruses on the basis of genomic sequence homologies, morphology and life cycle."

Another peptide used in this research included a dimer of the amino acid sequence KPV, specifically VPKCCKPV (SEQ_ID_NO_4), which also was N-acetylated and C-amidated (the “KPV dimer”). The KPV dimmer can be chemically represented as NH 2 -Val-Pro-Lys-Ac-Cys-Cys-Ac-Lys-Pro-Val-NH 2 (SEQ_ID_NO_4) . The peptides were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Organism and Culture Conditions S. aureus (ATCC 29213) and C. albicans (clinical isolate) were obtained from the collection of the Department of Microbiology, Ospedale Maggiore di Milano.
Context5:
The most effective of the α-MSH peptides were those including the C-terminal amino acid sequence KPV of the α-MSH sequence, i.e., α-MSH (1-13), (6-13) and (11-13). A dimer of the amino acid sequence KPV, specifically, VPKCCKPV (SEQ_ID_NO_4) (referred to herein as the “KPV dimer,” shown in FIG. 16) has also been shown to be at least as effective as α-MSH (11-13) against microbes. The α-MSH “core” sequence (4-10), which is known to influence learning and memory, but has little antipyretic and anti-inflammatory influence, was effective, but less so. The ACTH peptides (1-39) and (18-39) did not have significant candidacidal effects. These observations indicate that antimicrobial activity is not common to all melanocortin peptides, but rather that it is specific to α-MSH amino acid sequences, and most particularly to the C-terminal amino-acid sequences of α-MSH."

2. ""In particular, the presence of multiple alanine and leucine residues in the sequence has been found to be important for its anti-inflammatory activity."" This statement suggests that the repetitive ""Ala\_Leu"" pattern in the sequence might be relevant for its anti-inflammatory effects.
3. ""However, the precise mechanism by which the sequence exerts its anti-inflammatory effects is not yet fully understood."" This statement suggests that there is still much to be learned about how the sequence functions, and that it is possible that the sub-sequence ""Ala\_Leu\_Ala\_Leu\_Ala\_Leu\_Ala\_Leu\_Ala\_Leu\_Ala\_Leu\_Ala\_Leu\_Ala\_Leu\_Ala\_Leu\_Lys\_Lys"" could play a role in its anti-inflammatory activity.

Based on this analysis, I would say that the most supportive context numbers are 1 and 2, which suggest that the sequence as a whole has anti-inflammatory properties and that the repetitive ""Ala\_Leu"" pattern in the sequence might be important for its activity.

[0053] The modifications of E (esterified, glycosylated, or amidated) enhance delivery to target tissues by charge cationization of the peptide at physiological pH in the range of 6 to 8. Previously the terminal amide modification was introduced by Pert et al. (US Pat. 5,276,016) to provide protection from carboxypeptidase degradation of DAPTA, and others, including 

 Michaelis and Trigg or Andersen et al., have employed this rationale. That is not the function here, as SEQ_ID_NO_14, is fully protected to degradation and needs no terminal amide (-NH 2 ), ester, or glycosyl moiety to block proteases.

[0050] The authors then concluded: ""Amounts of all-D-bradykinin up to 50,000 times the the standard challenge of bradykinin showed neither any inhibition of the response to bradykinin, or any bradykinin-like effect.

No all-D-peptide of SEQ_ID_NO_1-13 of the present invention was claimed in these prior applications. [0052] The ability to make D for L amino acid substitutions in all positions however creates the possibility to make orally stable peptide compounds.

 all-D peptides that retain potency is an unexpected general method of creating peptides SEQ_ID_NO_1-13, and possibly others, which may be stabilized to proteolysis, while retaining biopotency, so these peptides benefit from enhanced stability. [0053] Thus, neither Pert et al. (US US 5276016), who first used D-amino acids in the octapeptide Peptide T (ASTTTNYT) (SEQ_ID_NO_14) to create the analog DAPTA (Dalal- peptide T-amide), or Michaelis and Trigg (US5,798,335), or Andersen et al (US 6011014 and US6,265,374) teach substitution of all of the naturally occurring L-amino acids by D-amino acids in Peptide T or DAPTA.

However, based on the information given, we can infer that this sequence might have anti-inflammatory effects as it shares some similarities with the Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) sequence mentioned in Context0 and Context8.

The VIP sequence (SEQ\_ID\_NO\_14 in Context0) has anti-inflammatory properties, and the sequence in question shares the same first 10 and last 5 amino acids with the VIP sequence. This similarity suggests that the sequence might also have anti-inflammatory effects. However, it is essential to note that the exact amino acid sequence is crucial for the peptide's function, and even a single amino acid change can result in different properties.

Based on the given contexts, the top 3 most supportive context numbers are Context0 and Context8, as they provide information about the anti-inflammatory properties of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP), which shares similarities with the sequence in question.

Thus, there is a medical need to find a pharmaceutical agent that shows a high efficacy in the treatment of inflammatory pulmonary diseases and at the same time allows for the generation of an aerosol in the desired liquid droplet or solid particle size range in order to be able to reach the alveoli of a patient in need thereof. Surprisingly, this task could be solved by the nebulization (preferred) or alternatively in the case of solid particles their suspension with a dry-powder inhaler in a gas (especially an oxygen comprising gas, such as air) of selected human anti-inflammatory peptides. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following human peptides were found to be outstandingly suitable for inhalatory application to a human suffering from a pulmonary disease: Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) 

VIP is a widely distributed human 28 amino acid neuropeptide. It belongs to a glucagon/secretin superfamily, being a ligand of class II G protein-coupled receptors (cf. Umetsu et al. (2011) Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1814: 724-730). It exists in the two isoforms 1 and 2, having the same amino acid sequence. VIP is post-translationally cleaved from 170 amino acid VIP peptides isoform 1 preproprotein (125-152) and 169 amino acid VIP peptides isoform 2 preproprotein (124-151). In the scope of the present application the term VIP shall refer to both isoforms, and especially to aviptadil. The amino acid sequence of human VIP is (from the N- to the C-terminus), also named aviptadil, as of GenelD 7432 and NP 003372.1 (isoform 1) and GenelD 7432 and NP 919416.1 (isoform 2), as of January 3rd, 2020: His-Ser-Asp-Ala-Val-Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Lys-GIn-Met-Ala-Val-Lys-Lys- Tyr-Leu-Asn-Ser-lle-Leu-Asn (SEQ_ID_NO_1 )."

However, I can determine that this sequence is related to B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) based on Context8. BNP is known to have cardiovascular functions, including vasodilation and diuresis, but there is no clear evidence in the given contexts suggesting its role in inflammation.

a “primary inflammatory or degenerative disease” refers to pulmonary diseases which are not autoimmune-mediated. If it is known that a healthy person is or will be vulnerable to inflammatory or degenerative diseases, or a tissue damage is to be expected due to a constant overstrain of the respective tissue or organ it can be indicated to give a prophylactic medication in order to prevent or at least to mitigate the expected impairment or damage. Thus, the present patent application refers also to a prophylactic use according to the invention, especially in the treatment of a chronic lung disease or disorder, especially of ARDS, preferably in patients suffering or having suffered from infection with a Coronavirus, especially SARS-CoV-2 (which causes CoViD-19). There are also cases in which an inflammatory pulmonary disease results in a degenerative disease. Examples therefore will be given further below.

The TAT-NEMO ActPep has been shown to inhibit NF-κB activity, but the specific anti-inflammatory properties of this sequence have not been explicitly stated in the provided contexts.

However, based on the information provided in Context0, the NEMO ActPep peptide, which is the basis for the TAT-NEMO ActPep sequence, is used as an IKK2 inhibitor that specifically inhibits IKK2 activation by targeting a second interaction interface between NEMO and IKK2 that is dependent upon NEMO binding to linear polyubiquitin. This inhibition does not block MAP kinase phosphorylation or IKK1 via a non-canonical NF-kB activation pathway. Therefore, it can be inferred that the TAT-NEMO ActPep sequence, which includes the NEMO ActPep sequence, may also have anti-inflammatory properties through its inhibition of IKK2 activation.

Additionally, Context6 states that the peptide NEMO ActPep does not block MAP kinase phosphorylation or IKK1 via the non-canonical NF-κB activation pathway and provides a method of treating and/or preventing inflammation in various diseases by targeting the NEMO:IKK2 interaction interface comprising the six conserved amino acids of QRRSPP (SEQ\_ID\_NO\_1), corresponding to amino acid residues 384-389 of human NEMO, to effectively inhibit IKK2 activation pathway. Since TAT-NEMO ActPep includes the QRRSPP sequence, it can be inferred that it may also have the ability to inhibit IKK2 activation and have anti-inflammatory properties.

Therefore, based on the information provided in Context0 and Context6, it can be inferred that the sequence SEQ\_ID\_NO\_2:Tyr\_Gly\_Arg\_Lys\_Lys\_Arg\_Arg\_Gln\_Arg\_Arg\_Arg\_Gly\_Gly\_Leu\_Ser\_Ser\_Pro\_Leu\_Ala\_Leu\_Pro\_Ser\_Gln\_Arg\_Arg\_Ser\_Pro\_Pro\_Glu\_Glu, which corresponds to the TAT-NEMO ActPep peptide, may have anti-inflammatory properties through its inhibition of IKK2 activation.

In both experiments, cells were treated with versions of NEMO ActPep and NEMO ActPep 6G lacking the N-terminal HIV-1 TAT cell permeabilization peptide sequence. Rather, the peptides were introduced to cells in combination with the indicated amounts (in μM) of K16ApoE synthetic transport peptide. This shows that the inhibitor effect on NF-κB activity of NEMO ActPep is not reliant upon the HIV-1 TAT peptide. EMSA of Ig-κB DNA binding by HeLa cell nuclear lysates and autodradiography was performed as described in Figs.5A-5D.

Context3:
After 16 hours, 200 μM of the peptide having the amino acid of SEQ_ID_NO_1 and 20 ng/ml of IL-4 (R&D system, 204-IL-010/CF) as a positive control were inoculated, and after 24 hours, the cell culture medium was obtained. The amounts of IL-6 (R&D system, D6050) and TNF-α (R&D system, DTA00D), which are inflammatory cytokines secreted by cells present in the medium, were confirmed through ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). As a result, as shown in FIG. 3, when the peptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ_ID_NO_1 was treated (LPS + S3), IL-6 and TNF-α values were similar to those when IL-4 was treated. It was confirmed that it lowered to . When only LPS was treated, IL-6 and TNF-α values increased. Accordingly, it was found that the peptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ_ID_NO_1 has an anti-inflammatory effect.
Context4:
As a result, it was confirmed that the peptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ_ID_NO_1 inhibits the expression of pNF-κB induced by LPS. In another aspect, it was confirmed that the peptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ_ID_NO_1 has excellent antibacterial activity against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis , which are periodontitis-causing bacteria, and has equal or similar antibacterial activity compared to minocycline, which is widely used in the treatment of periodontitis.
